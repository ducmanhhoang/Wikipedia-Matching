Roma was an Italian semi-rigid airship, originally designated the T-34. It was purchased by the United States from the Italian government for $250,000 in 1921.  It served in the US Army until February 21, 1922, when it crashed in Norfolk, Virginia, killing 34 people.  It was the last hydrogen filled airship used by the US; all future ships were filled with helium.
Design and developmentThe Roma was designed by Celestino Usuelli, the engineers Eugenio Prassone, Umberto Nobile and Colonel Gaetano Arturo Crocco.Flight (1920) It was the first project of the Stabilimento Costruzioni Aeronautiche ("Aeronautical Construction Factory"), as the partnership of Umberto Nobile, Usuelli, Giuseppe Valle and Bennetto Croce was known. The T-34 was designed for trans-Atlantic crossings.  It was the largest semi-rigid airship in the world.As a semi-rigid design it was built about a rigid keel - though the keel was partially articulated to allow some flexibility. The passenger spaces and control cabin were within the keel. The engines, 400 hp Ansaldos, were mounted outside, angled such that the slipstreams would not interfere with each other.
ServiceIn September 1920 Roma made a trial flight.Flight 23 September 1920 p.1021After purchase by the US, in March 1921 the Roma flew the 300 miles from Rome to Naples and back carrying the US Ambassador.Flight 24 March 1921 p.202After transportation to the US, Roma flew on 15 November 1921 with minor problems.Flight 29 December 1921 p.862
The Roma crashed in Norfolk, Virginia during test flights on February 21, 1922. The crash was believed to be caused by failure of the Romas box rudder system, which allowed it to maneuver over tight areas. The ship contacted high voltage lines, and burst into flames. A total of 34 were killed, 8 were injured, and 3 escaped unharmed. Among the dead was the airship's pilot, Captain Dale Mabry.  The event marked the greatest disaster in American aeronautics to that time.
