is an airship semi-rigid built in the USSR and designed by the aeronautical engineer Italian Umberto Nobile.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">The name of the aircraft was borrowed from the name of the establishment where it was manufactured : "the Society for the promotion of defence, aviation and chemistry" (in Russian ОСОАВИАХИМ).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td

leaders wanted to develop their own national program but has none of the engineering specialist in this field and wanting to advance very quickly in their program, have a guest in the USSR, the Italian Umberto Nobile, recognized at the time as the best specialist of the airships.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td style="background-color: LightGreen">The engineer had been dishonoured, in the eyes of fascism, after the disaster of the airship Nobile N. 2 Italia when returning from his 3rd expedition to the North Pole in 1928.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">In

beginning, he must face several difficulties : the aircraft factory was nothing more than a simple hangar for dirigibles-free workshops and tooling mechanics.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">Nobile has in advance ensure the training of crews and technicians for the construction of new airships.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">It was not until the summer of 1933 it was possible to begin the construction of the airship W6, aircraft in all points similar to the Nobile N. 1 Norge and Nobile N. 2 Italia.These difficulties seem to have stemmed from the fact that in the Soviet Union, never the direction and responsibility of projects of such importance have been entrusted to a stranger.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">The soviet engineers had built earlier airship-semi-rigid 9150 m3, which was completed in August 1934 W7 receive the

the Soviet Union from 1931 to 1936, Umberto Nobile designed airships for the transportation of passengers.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td style="background-color: LightGrey">The W6 was to ensure the regular line between Moscow and Sverdlovsk.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td style="background-color: LightGrey">It could not be used because there was no post boarding, no mast anchor or the possibility of refuelling.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">In 1936, a mast mooring has finally been erected in Sverdlovsk.In 1937, captain Pankow led the W6 during 79 hours on the route Moscow-Sverdlovsk-Moscow with the continuous operation of the engines.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">This was the record of operation of 130 hours and 27 minutes, which was not defeated until 20 years later.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">The race record began in Dolgoproudny (Russian Долгопрудный) on 29 September and ended on 4 October.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">The distance was about 5,000 km.</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">This trip was the preparation of a regular link in the airship.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td style="background-color: LightGreen">The catastropheLe February 5, 1938, at 16h45, a group of explorers and researchers soviets, led by Ivan Papanin, was surprised by sudden movements of the drifting ice in the Arctic.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The mission that was assigned to the

conditions.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">During this trip, the airship collided with the "Mont Neblo" (in Russian Небло), near the town of Kandalaksha, mount

from the previous maps and, because of the poor visibility ambient, he had given the order to sail to 800 meters of altitude, but Ivan Pankow, the second in command, had put too much time before retransmitting this order, and the balloon stayed at an altitude of 300 m. On the 19 people on board 13 were killed in the cabin, three others were injured.FliegerRevue Januar 2010, S. 54-55, Die gescheiterte Rettungsfahrt The victims are buried in the [[graveyard of Novodevitchi]) in Moscow.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">The researchers of the expedition were rescued by icebreakers.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td style="background-color: LightSalmon">This accident put an end to the soviet program of the great airships.In 1968, on the mountain Neblo, to the place where the airship crashed, the students and the local authorities have erected a monument next to the remains of the accident.</td></tr></table></body></html>
