is the robe said to have been worn by Jesus during (or shortly before) his crucifixion.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The relic is preserved in the Cathedral of Trier in Germany.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">According to the Gospel of John, the soldiers who crucified Jesus did not divide his tunic after crucifying him, but cast lots to determine who would keep it because it was woven in one piece, without seam.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">A distinction is made in the New Testament Greek between the  “Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments (ta himatia) and divided them into four parts, to every soldier a part, and the coat (kai ton chitona).</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">Now the coat was without seam, woven whole from the top down.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style="background-color:

Scripture was fulfilled: they divided My raiment (ta imatia) among them, and upon My vesture (epi ton himatismon) did they cast lots” (John 19:23-24; quoting the Septuagint version of Psalm 21  :18-19).</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">Western traditionAccording to legend Helena, mother of Constantine the Great discovered the seamless robe in the Holy Land in the year 327 or 328 along with several other relics, including the True Cross.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">According to different versions of the story, she either bequeathed it or sent it to the city of Trier, where Constantine had lived for some years before becoming emperor.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">(The monk Altmann of Hautvillers wrote in the 9th century that Helena was born in that city, though this report is strongly disputed by most modern historians.)</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td style="background-color:

an altar in which the seamless robe was contained.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">It is no longer possible to determine the exact historical path that the robe took to arrive there, so that many hold it to be a medieval forgery.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The various attempts at preservation and restoration through the centuries have made it difficult to determine how much of the relic (if genuine) actually stems from the time of Jesus.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">A scientific examination of the specimen has not been conducted.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The stigmatist Therese Neumann of Konnersreuth declared that the Trier robe was authentic.Albert

Dome and exhibited it.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The people of Trier heard about that and demanded to see the Holy Robe.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td

Orthodox Church has also preserved a tradition regarding the clothing of Jesus which was divided among the soldiers after the crucifixion.According to the tradition of the Georgian Orthodox Church,
