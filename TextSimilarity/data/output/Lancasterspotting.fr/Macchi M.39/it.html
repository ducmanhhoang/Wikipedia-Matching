M. 72 and 73, and the other three, the M. M. 74, 75 and 76, in the configuration of stroke, equipped with the engine AS.2 equipped with two-blade propeller with metal and with a wingspan reduced to 9,26 m. TecnicaCome and whereas, the M. 39 was a idrocorsa from the setting, to the era of the modern, innovative in the panorama of the Italian sports sector, construction of mixed wood and metal, cell monoplana with group motoelica in tractor configuration and the floating "boots".</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The fuselage was made with a structure entirely made of wood, covered with plywood, and only in the sections near the engine, metal.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The wing uses the same principle: two frame members molded case circuit breakers in the fir, on which were placed the ribs pulleys supporting a plywood covering.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The wing was reinforced with a series of steel tie rods high-strength, that connected the boots with the longitudinal members and the latter with the firewall.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The feature that distinguished this aircraft from earlier was surely the presence of the radiators to touch on the back and the belly of the wings and on the front of the muzzle.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">These were made of brass tubes with reduced thickness, inside of which flowed through the cooling liquid.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The building of the "spartan" of the plane, testified his vocation velocistica, also underlined by the research of the maximum lightness.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">ImpiegoIl the first M. 39 to detach from the surface of the Lake of Varese, in front of the seaplane base of the Schiranna owned by Macchi, was the M.
