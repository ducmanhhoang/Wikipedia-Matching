TecnicaL'S.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">58 was a seaplane to the hull central from the appearance of the conventional single-seater biplane to the main hull, single-engine configuration pusher.The hull had a single cockpit, open-intended for the pilot is protected by a windshield.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">Rear ended in a fin monoderiva with horizontal planes braced.The configuration the wingspan was biplane-sesquiplana, with the lower wing smaller than the upper one, connected by a pair of uprights and obliques per side, supplemented by the rods in the steel cable.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue">The lower wing mounts to the wing on the hull, was characterized by a dihedral angle is positive in contrast to the upper, is mounted high to the sun visor, the latter connected to the hull by a castle tubular along the nacelle.The propulsion was ensured by a motor positioned in a configuration pushing, which is different in the three versions created, all linked to a two-blade propeller in fixed pitch wooden.</td></tr></table></body></html>
