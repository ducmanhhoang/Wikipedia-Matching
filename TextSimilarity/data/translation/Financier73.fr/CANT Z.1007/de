History and design of the Z. 1007 by Filippo Zappata in the case of CRDA CANT (Cantieri Riuniti dell’Adriatico – Cantiere Navale Triestino) in 1935. was designed The first flight took place on 11.

From 1939 to 1943, 561 machines were built.The plane was based on a wooden construction, which, however, could raise under extreme climatic conditions, such as in Africa and Russia problems. The machines of the first series received three engines Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI with the 825 HP (607 kW) of power and wooden two blade propeller, but these were quickly replaced by three laminar metal propeller. The first 34 machines still had a ring radiator, however, serious motor occurred during these problems with the machine, so that the new radial engines Piaggio P. XI R. 2C 40 with 1000 HP (736 kW) needed to power to be installed.This new aircraft was called the Z. 1007bis.

At the beginning of 1943, the Version bar, for example, 1007ter with 1150 HP Piaggio P. XIX-double-star motors manufactured, which was up to 500 km/h.The Z. 1015 was a military mail plane with Piaggio P. XII-RC.35-engines, each of 1500 HP of power. The prototype reached 560 km/h and a range of 3000 km.The 516 was a water plane with the body of a Z. 1007 and the floats of a CRDA CANT Z. 506.
Use geschichteim the spring of 1940, were delivered in the first Z. 1007bis of the units. In September 1940, the first against England was flown in from Belgium. The stakes, however, had only moderate success. After the Invasion in Greece in October 1940 was used, the Z. 1007bis strong in the Mediterranean, such as Malta and North Africa.
