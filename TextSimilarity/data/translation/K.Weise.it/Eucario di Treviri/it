According to the legend, Eucario would have been a disciple of st. Peter, which would have sent him and two others of his disciples, Valerio, and Mother, to evangelize Gaul and the surrounding population. However, because the three saints were bishops in the diocese, founded more than a century later, the legend is inconsistent.
CultoIl worship of sant ' Eucherio is tried since the 455 and the legend is attested in the VIII century. Saint Gregory of Tours describes him as a "Protector of the city of Trier against epidemics".
The legend tells also that he would raise the companion Breast from her sarcophagus, using the pastoral staff of St. Peter's.The tradition of Trier said that he would have destroyed a statue of Venus, putting in place the current Cross.
