The Piaggio P. 7 was an Experimental and racing aircraft project of the Italian manufacturer Piaggio, from the year 1929. Was planned to be used at the Schneider Cup race.
GeschichteUm speed advantages over the conventional built in the 1920s witnesses to achieve, was omitted in the construction of the P. 7 on the float. For the Start, the aircraft should be accelerated by means of a screw propeller and with "Skikufen" out of the water to be lifted. Thereafter, the main drive through Umkoppeln of the ship should be redirected to screw on the Propeller to generate the propulsion aerodynamic.
It was only built a prototype that flew but never. Massive problems Umkuppeln of the drive train of 723 kW (1000 HP) V6 engine led to the termination of the Experiments.
