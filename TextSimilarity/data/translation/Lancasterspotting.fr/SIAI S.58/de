GeschichteIm 1923, the Regia Marina launched a call for tender for a new hunting flying boat in the Italian Navy, the successor to the SIAI S. 13. SIAI was involved with the s. 58 in the tender, but lost out in 1929, just under the Macchi M. 41bis.To be able to participate in the tender of the Navy to participate, to put SIAI with the p. 58 a new project. The designer of the SIAI introduced in 1924, his concept in the Navy, he focused strongly on the S. 51, and added new developments, p. 56 and p. 57. It should be an agile, quick and stable fighter plane. He sat on the Hispano-Suiza 42 engine with 300 horsepower and the tried-and-tested two-blade propeller. The single-seat flying boat should be equipped with two 7.7 mm machine guns. 25. August 1924 launched the S. 58 for the first time and set at a loading of 250 kg, the rate of climb 6.5 m/s, a new world record for flying boats. However, none of the aircraft involved in the tender was grown, the requirements of the Navy. In the case of a new tender in 1927 SIAI involved with the s. 58 in the Version of S. 58bis, upgraded the machine, however, with a Fiat A 20 with 420 HP to throw more power into the equation. As armament, they chose two 7.7 mm Vickers machine guns. With repairs, it was involved in 1929, at the third invitation to tender for the Navy with the slightly improved Version of S. 58ter and was subject to just the Macchi M. 41bis. It was agreed, however, that the us Navy purchased the prototype for training with the marine aviators.
The S. 58 was a double-Decker flying boat with a flat bottom wooden hull was reinforced with metal. She had an open Cockpit in which a Pilot could sit. The Fiat A-20 engine with 420 HP was fixed, as is the case with the predecessors, in the middle of the upper wing. Worthy of mention is the V-Shaped tail, the reinforced construction of the wings and ailerons on the upper wing, that had been installed in the p. 56 and p. 57 with success. The machine guns were mounted rigidly in the aircraft fuselage forward of the Cockpit. The first Version was equipped with a Hispano-Suiza 42 engine with 300 HP. In the second tender with the competition, developed an improved Version with a Fiat A20, 12-cylinder V-engine with 420 HP, which they called the S. 58bis. In the third tender, in 1929, in addition, metal reinforcements were made to the fuselage and on the wings, and the Pilot got a headrest; this military version was conducted under S. 58ter.
