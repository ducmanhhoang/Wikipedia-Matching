[8]The Z.1007 design was preferred by both Zappata and the Italian Aviation Ministry, with an order for 18 aircraft being placed on 9 January 1936.
[9]A further order for 16 more aircraft followed on 23 February 1937.
[11]The Cant Z.1007 was developed from the CANT Z.506 seaplane,  an aircraft that had established many world records in the late 1930s.
[12]It was a land-based version and incorporated many improvements, especially on the powerplant.The first prototype flew in March 1937, proving superior to the Z.1011, with its handling and manoeuvrability being praised.
[13]Its performance, however, was lower than predicted, and Zappata therefore started a major redesign of the Z.1007, production of the initial version being limited to the existing orders placed before the prototype flew.The Z.1007 was a mid-winged monoplane with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage.

[19]While the new version was of similar layout, it was a new design.
[18]Z.1007bisZappata had, meanwhile, continued the development of a considerably changed version, the Z.1007bis, to resolve the problems with the original aircraft.
[20]Three Piaggio P.XI RC.40 radial engines (a derivative of the French Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K) of 736 kW (986 hp) takeoff power replaced the less powerful and unreliable liquid cooled engines of the original version.

[5]It was used by the Italian Regia Aeronautica, Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana and Luftwaffe during World War II.
[4]and was regarded by some as  "the best Italian bomber of World War II" although its wooden structure was easily damaged by the climate, like those experienced in North Africa and in Russia.
[7]Both were to be powered by 619 kW (830 hp) Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI.RC inline engines and were of wooden construction.

[39]The Z.1007's wooden structure suffered cracks, separations and surface delamination due to the difficult climatic conditions in North Africa and Russia.
[37]Other issues were poor engine reliability and a weak power-to-weight ratio due to low powered engines (the three 1,000 hp engines of the Z.1007bis were equivalent to twin engines of 1,500 hp each, but this was slightly offset by the added weight of the third engine).

[16]After much experimentation with the prototype, the production aircraft were fitted with annular radiators so their profile was similar to radial engines that would be fitted to the improved later versions.
[14]It had a crew of five, consisting of two pilots, a flight engineer, a radio operator and a bombardier/navigator.
[15]It could carry 800 kg (1,760 lb) of bombs, and was fitted with a defensive armament of a 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine gun in an open dorsal position and a 7.7 mm machine gun in a ventral tunnel.

[26]The Z.1007 had three engines, with one engine in the nose and two in the wings.
[24]The Z.1007 had a standard monoplane configuration, with a mid-set wing, single tail, retractable undercarriage and a crew of five or six.

[46]The 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda was a standard weapon for Italian bombers and the field of fire was improved by the twin-tail configuration on later models.
[48]Another 12.7 mm (.5 in) was in the ventral position behind the bomb bay, with a field of fire restricted to the lower rear quadrant of the aircraft.

[54]The pilots were protected with 5 mm (.20 in) roof and lateral armor, 6 mm (.24 in) around the seats, 5 mm (.20 in) overhead, and a 6 mm (.24 in) armored bulkhead behind them.The Z.1007 had a long, shallow horizontal bomb bay which could carry 1,200 kg (2,650 lb) of ordnance.
[55]Many other Italian aircraft had bomb bays which carried the ordnance vertically, tip pointing up, which limited the size and variety of bombs which could be carried internally, a problem shared with the German He 111 bomber.
[56]There were also a pair of under-wing hardpoints which could carry up to 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of bombs, giving the Z.1007 a potential 2,200 kg (4,900 lb) payload and a maximum range of 640 km (400 mi), but the norm was 1,200 kg and 1,000 km range.

[124]Test pilots were more impressed by this machine than the Z.1018, faster but with less power (because of the layout with only two P.XII engines), while the range was improved from 2,000 km (1,240 mi) to 2,250 km (1,400 mi) with 2,460 kg (5,420 lb) fuel and 900 kg (1,980 lb) bombs.
[122]This version was dropped because of the advent of the Z.1018 and the unreliability of the engines.

[23]The Z.1007bis was ordered into large scale production, deliveries of pre-production aircraft starting late that year.Green 1992, pp. 84, 86.

[38]The Z.1007 also suffered longitudinal stability problems that were partly rectified later by the adoption of a twin tail arrangement.

[78]In 1942, Z.1007s were used by four groups and two wings in the Mediterranean theatre, in anti-ship role and against Malta, often escorted by Italian and German fighters.In November 1942, there were 10 Gruppi equipped with 75 Z.1007s, with just 39 serviceable aircraft.De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 39.
[80]Only on 14 August, at the end of that "Mid-August Battle", three Z.1007bis  bombed the convoy from high altitude.De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 38.
[81]Another Z.1007bis took part in the battle, carrying out a first in the war special mission, later copied by Allied air forces.

[101]Upon arrival in September the Italian command realized the Luftwaffe had already photographed nearly every inch of S.E. England and there was really nothing for them to do.

[76]The first large-scale use of the CANT  took place when the Italian invasion of Greece started at the end of October 1940.
[74]The British destroyer   was sunk by an explosion caused by a Z.1007 bombing in 1941.
