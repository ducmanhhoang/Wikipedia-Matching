[1]History and design of the Z. 1007 by Filippo Zappata in the case of CRDA CANT (Cantieri Riuniti dell’Adriatico – Cantiere Navale Triestino) in 1935.

[6]The machines of the first series received three engines Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI with the 825 HP (607 kW) of power and wooden two blade propeller, but these were quickly replaced by three laminar metal propeller.
[7]The first 34 machines still had a ring radiator, however, serious motor occurred during these problems with the machine, so that the new radial engines Piaggio P. XI R. 2C 40 with 1000 HP (736 kW) needed to power to be installed.This new aircraft was called the Z. 1007bis.

[5]From 1939 to 1943, 561 machines were built.The plane was based on a wooden construction, which, however, could raise under extreme climatic conditions, such as in Africa and Russia problems.

[9]Later Z. 1007bis a double side received fin.The crew consisted of five people (Pilot, Copilot, radio operator/gunner, tail gunner and a gunner who operated the remote-controlled MGs).
[11]The aircraft could carry either 1200 kg of bombs internally or 1000 kg of bombs externally, or two, or 17.7-inch torpedoes.

[8]The machine got a new tailplane, a turret on the plane back, and two 12,7-mm-MGs in the rear floor pan.
[10]In the back of the tower and the hull tub, two 12.7 mm were installed in the MGs.
