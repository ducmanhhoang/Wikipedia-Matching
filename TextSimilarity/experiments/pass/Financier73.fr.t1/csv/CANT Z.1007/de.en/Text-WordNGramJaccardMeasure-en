[8]The Z.1007 design was preferred by both Zappata and the Italian Aviation Ministry, with an order for 18 aircraft being placed on 9 January 1936.
[9]A further order for 16 more aircraft followed on 23 February 1937.

[14]It had a crew of five, consisting of two pilots, a flight engineer, a radio operator and a bombardier/navigator.
[12]It was a land-based version and incorporated many improvements, especially on the powerplant.The first prototype flew in March 1937, proving superior to the Z.1011, with its handling and manoeuvrability being praised.

[19]While the new version was of similar layout, it was a new design.
[18]Z.1007bisZappata had, meanwhile, continued the development of a considerably changed version, the Z.1007bis, to resolve the problems with the original aircraft.
[20]Three Piaggio P.XI RC.40 radial engines (a derivative of the French Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K) of 736 kW (986 hp) takeoff power replaced the less powerful and unreliable liquid cooled engines of the original version.

[5]It was used by the Italian Regia Aeronautica, Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana and Luftwaffe during World War II.
[4]and was regarded by some as  "the best Italian bomber of World War II" although its wooden structure was easily damaged by the climate, like those experienced in North Africa and in Russia.
[7]Both were to be powered by 619 kW (830 hp) Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI.RC inline engines and were of wooden construction.

[39]The Z.1007's wooden structure suffered cracks, separations and surface delamination due to the difficult climatic conditions in North Africa and Russia.
[37]Other issues were poor engine reliability and a weak power-to-weight ratio due to low powered engines (the three 1,000 hp engines of the Z.1007bis were equivalent to twin engines of 1,500 hp each, but this was slightly offset by the added weight of the third engine).

[16]After much experimentation with the prototype, the production aircraft were fitted with annular radiators so their profile was similar to radial engines that would be fitted to the improved later versions.
[14]It had a crew of five, consisting of two pilots, a flight engineer, a radio operator and a bombardier/navigator.
[15]It could carry 800 kg (1,760 lb) of bombs, and was fitted with a defensive armament of a 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine gun in an open dorsal position and a 7.7 mm machine gun in a ventral tunnel.

[44]The turret had a good field of fire, although it had blind spot behind the tail (as did all turreted aircraft without rear gunners or twin vertical stabilizers).
[42]ArmamentThe Z.1007 had a defensive armament of four machine guns: two 12.7 mm (.5 in) and two 7.7 mm (.303 in).
[46]The 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda was a standard weapon for Italian bombers and the field of fire was improved by the twin-tail configuration on later models.
[48]Another 12.7 mm (.5 in) was in the ventral position behind the bomb bay, with a field of fire restricted to the lower rear quadrant of the aircraft.

[99]Battle of BritainThe Z.1007 saw action during the later stages of the Battle of Britain from November 1940 to January 1941.
[101]Upon arrival in September the Italian command realized the Luftwaffe had already photographed nearly every inch of S.E. England and there was really nothing for them to do.

[76]The first large-scale use of the CANT  took place when the Italian invasion of Greece started at the end of October 1940.
[74]The British destroyer   was sunk by an explosion caused by a Z.1007 bombing in 1941.

[95]The Italian units were joined by Luftwaffe II Fliegerkorp, but when the German aircraft were moved to North Africa, the CANT bombing missions on Malta were reduced.

[97]The "Alcione" started a third wave of night attacks on Malta between 10 and 20 October 1942.
