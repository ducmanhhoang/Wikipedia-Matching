[1]The CANT Z.1007 Alcione (Kingfisher) was a three-engined medium bomber, with wooden structure.
[4]and was regarded by some as  "the best Italian bomber of World War II" although its wooden structure was easily damaged by the climate, like those experienced in North Africa and in Russia.
[5]It was used by the Italian Regia Aeronautica, Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana and Luftwaffe during World War II.
[6]In 1935, Filippo Zappata, the chief designer of the Cantieri Aeronautici e Navali Triestini (CANT), designed two medium bombers, the twin-engined CANT Z.1011 and the three-engined CANT Z.1007.

[24]The Z.1007 had a standard monoplane configuration, with a mid-set wing, single tail, retractable undercarriage and a crew of five or six.

[36]Like most trimotor Italian aircraft of the period the Z.1007 suffered from poor defensive armament, although it was no worse than many other contemporary designs, many of which had no rotating dorsal turret, no waist guns, or no ventral gun, or various combinations of such.
[37]Other issues were poor engine reliability and a weak power-to-weight ratio due to low powered engines (the three 1,000 hp engines of the Z.1007bis were equivalent to twin engines of 1,500 hp each, but this was slightly offset by the added weight of the third engine).
[38]The Z.1007 also suffered longitudinal stability problems that were partly rectified later by the adoption of a twin tail arrangement.
[39]The Z.1007's wooden structure suffered cracks, separations and surface delamination due to the difficult climatic conditions in North Africa and Russia.

[65]In 1942, it was proposed to modify the remaining 16 Z.1007s for weather reconnaissance, re-engining them with Isotta Fraschini Delta engines, but only one aircraft was converted.
[66]The Z.1007 participated in the bombing campaign over Malta and in the campaigns in North Africa and on the Eastern Front.

[63]The Asso powered bombers were not considered suitable for operational use, however, owing to the unreliability of their engines and high maintenance requirements, while their defensive armament was considered inadequate.

[115]Final deploymentIn June 1943, the Z.1007s at Perugia, originally equipped with 30 machines, dropped to 19 with 13 serviceable in September.
[113]During that short invasion, Regia Aeronautica deployed 49 CANT.

[71]Cant Z.1007 Asso replaced SM.81s in 16° Stormo, 47° Stormo had Z.1007Bis but operational readiness was only reached in August, when around 30 machines were sent to Sicily to attack Malta.

[88]World War IIWhen Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940, Regia Aeronautica had two Stormi equipped with the "Alcione".
[89]One was the 16°, with 31 aircraft, equipped with the Isotta Fraschini engine and so declared non bellici ('not suitable for war') The 47° Stormo had just received four CANT bis.De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 34.

[78]In 1942, Z.1007s were used by four groups and two wings in the Mediterranean theatre, in anti-ship role and against Malta, often escorted by Italian and German fighters.In November 1942, there were 10 Gruppi equipped with 75 Z.1007s, with just 39 serviceable aircraft.De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 39.
[79]As part of Italian and German efforts to stop the British operation Pedestal convoy to re-supply Malta in August 1942, a few Z.1007 Alciones of 51° Gruppo Autonomo based in Alghero, Sardinia, flew reconnaissance missions on the convoy between bombing and raids.
[80]Only on 14 August, at the end of that "Mid-August Battle", three Z.1007bis  bombed the convoy from high altitude.De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 38.

[83]The SM.79, without crew and armament, but packed with explosives and equipped with a radio control device, was to be used as a "Flying Bomb" against big naval targets.
[84]As the Pedestal Convoy was off the Algerian coast on 12 August 1942, the SM.79 "Drone", the Z.1007bis guide aircraft and escort of five FIAT G.50 fighters flew out to intercept the ships.

[90]The "Alcione" received its baptism of fire on 29 August 1940, when a formation of 10 CANT Z.1007bis monoderiva of 106° Gruppo bombed Luqa airfield.
[91]The 106°, based on Chinisia, Trapani, in Sicily, was soon joined by the whole 47° Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre with 33 aircraft.
[92]When the war with Greece broke out, the 47° was moved onto that front.
[93]The CANT Z. came back on Malta in 1941, with 9° Stormo Bombardamento terrestre, still based on Chinisia, with 29° and 33° Gruppo, equipped with 25 "Alcione".

[94]The 9° was later joined by 50° Gruppo, based on Sciacca.
[95]The Italian units were joined by Luftwaffe II Fliegerkorp, but when the German aircraft were moved to North Africa, the CANT bombing missions on Malta were reduced.
[96]The Italian bombers had to face the strengthened defences of the island, which employed radar combined with Bristol Beaufighter night fighters.
[97]The "Alcione" started a third wave of night attacks on Malta between 10 and 20 October 1942.
[98]The 9° Stormo and the 8° Gruppo of 43° Stormo had on line 30 CANT but only 12 were operational.
[99]Battle of BritainThe Z.1007 saw action during the later stages of the Battle of Britain from November 1940 to January 1941.
[100]The Regia Aereonautica sent six Z.1007Bis of the 172a Squadriglia to Belgium in the strategic reconnaissance role for the Corpo Aereo Italiano.
[101]Upon arrival in September the Italian command realized the Luftwaffe had already photographed nearly every inch of S.E. England and there was really nothing for them to do.
[102]They were used in force only once, on 11 November 1940, when five were used as a decoy (without bombs or guns) to draw RAF fighters away from the main Italian attack on a convoy and the port facilities around Harwich by 10 Fiat BR 20 bombers.
[99]Battle of BritainThe Z.1007 saw action during the later stages of the Battle of Britain from November 1940 to January 1941.
[103]The plan failed.
[104]No Z.1007s were lost over Britain, although one of the six originally sent was lost in September on the ferry flight to its base in Belgium.
[105]Greco-Italian WarDuring the invasion of Greece, the Regia Aeronautica deployed the largest number of CANT.Zs.
[106]On 28 October 1940, first day of invasion, 47° Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre (based on Grottaglie airfield) and 50° Gruppo of 50° Stormo (based on Brindisi airfield) had on line 44 Alcione.
[107]On 5 November, those units were joined by 41° Gruppo of 12° Stormo, with 16 aircraft.De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 37.
[109]During January 1941, 41° Gruppo was replaced by 95° Gruppo of 35° Stormo.
[111]The heavy rains damaged it, forcing continuous repairs by the ground crews.De Marchi e Tonizzo 1994, p. 38.
[112]YugoslaviaThe CANTs opened hostilities against Yugoslavia, on 6 April 1941, bombing Mostar airfield.
[113]During that short invasion, Regia Aeronautica deployed 49 CANT.

[20]Three Piaggio P.XI RC.40 radial engines (a derivative of the French Gnome-Rhône 14K) of 736 kW (986 hp) takeoff power replaced the less powerful and unreliable liquid cooled engines of the original version.
[21]The bis was longer with wings of greater span and area, while the aircraft was considerably heavier, weighing 580 kg (1,280 lb) more unladen, with a maximum takeoff weight 888 kg (1,960 lb) greater, while it carried heavier offensive and defensive armament.Green 1992, p. 83.

[121]Z.1007ter was an improved version, that should have used Alfa 135 engines of 1,040 kW (1,400 hp).
[122]This version was dropped because of the advent of the Z.1018 and the unreliability of the engines.
[124]Test pilots were more impressed by this machine than the Z.1018, faster but with less power (because of the layout with only two P.XII engines), while the range was improved from 2,000 km (1,240 mi) to 2,250 km (1,400 mi) with 2,460 kg (5,420 lb) fuel and 900 kg (1,980 lb) bombs.

[56]There were also a pair of under-wing hardpoints which could carry up to 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of bombs, giving the Z.1007 a potential 2,200 kg (4,900 lb) payload and a maximum range of 640 km (400 mi), but the norm was 1,200 kg and 1,000 km range.
[57]The Z.1007's external hardpoints were a rarity in the bombers of the Regia Aereonautica.
[58]The Z.1007 could also carry two 454 mm (17.7 in), 800 kg (1,760 lb) torpedoes slung externally under the belly in an anti-shipping role, an option never used operationally.
