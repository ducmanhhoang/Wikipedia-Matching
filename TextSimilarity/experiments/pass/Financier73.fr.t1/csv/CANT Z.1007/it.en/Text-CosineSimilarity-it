[37]The 106º, based on Chinisia, Trapani, in Sicily, was soon joined by the entire 47º Stormo Bombardment of the Earth with a total availability of 33 aircraft.
[38]When the war broke out with Greece, the 47º was moved on that front.

[45]The Regia Aeronautica sent six Z. 1007Bis of the 172ª Squadron in Belgium as a reconnaissance aircraft for the Airplane Body Italian.
[46]But when the aircraft reached its base, to September, the command realized the Luftwaffe had already photographed the “belt” of the south-east of England, and the Italian aircraft were used in the forces for just one day, the 11th of November 1940, when five “Alcione” were sent as “air bait and switch” to lure the hunting of the RAF away from the main objective of the Italian attack on the port of Harwich led by ten Fiat BR.20.

[50]On the 5th of November, these units were side-by-side from the 41st Group of the 12th Stormo, with 16 aircraft.
[51]In this campaign, the Flocks suffered a few losses, and during January 1941, the 41st Group was replaced by the 95 th Group of the 35th Squadron.
[52]But it was precisely in this theater of operations that, due to torrential rain, proved to be the weaknesses of the wood structure, which forced to make continuous adjustments and tightening which reduced the efficiency of the aircraft.
