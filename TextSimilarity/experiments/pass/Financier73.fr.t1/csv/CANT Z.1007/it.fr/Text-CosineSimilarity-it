[25]The CANT Z. 1007bis was intended as a bomber on the Greek front, in the Aegean in 1941 the 210ª Squadron sank the destroyers of the Royal Navy HMS Juno), and over the whole mediterranean zone.
[26]Use in north Africa proved to be difficult due to the difficulty of maintenance under high temperature, as well as to the limits of tactical aircraft in the exchequer.

[28]In 1943 they were removed from the first line and for night missions, with slight changes to the exhaust systems of the engines.On January 28, 1941, ten Alcione was addressed two times, the first by a formation of ten hunting and the second from one of the twelve, are both made up of biplanes Gloster Gladiator.
[30]During the "battle of half August" to stop the convoy Pedestal, en route to Malta in August 1942, only a few Z. 1007 Alcione of the 51st Gruppo Autonomo based in Alghero, in Sardinia, he carried out missions of reconnaissance on the convoy.
[31]Only on the 14th of August, at the end of the battle, three 1007bis bombed from high altitude, the enemy ships.
[32]During that battle, a CANT specially modified by means of an apparatus of radio-guide created by the general Ferdinando Raffaelli, would have had to drive a SIAI Marchetti S. M. 79 ARP (Aircraft Radio Controlled), without crew and armament, but the explosive cargo, as a "flying bomb" against the convoy.
[33]But the mission failed due to a trivial technical problem and was not retried.
[34]After the armistice, the appliances recovered in the south were framed in the Flock at Night and used to aviolanci of weapons and golden crops, so the Italian units still operating in the Balkans and the yugoslavian partisans.

[37]The 106º, based on Chinisia, Trapani, in Sicily, was soon joined by the entire 47º Stormo Bombardment of the Earth with a total availability of 33 aircraft.
[38]When the war broke out with Greece, the 47º was moved on that front.
[39]The CANT Z. came back on Malta in 1941, with the 9º Stormo Bombardment of the terrestrial, with the 29th and 33rd Gruppo, equipped with 25 "Alcione".
[41]The two Italian units-were accompanied by the II Fliegerkorps of the Luftwaffe, but when the German planes were transferred to north Africa, bombing missions over Malta of the CANT were reduced, also because the bombers were cope with the enhanced air defense of the island, which employed the radar combined with the night fighter Bristol Beaufighter.

[46]But when the aircraft reached its base, to September, the command realized the Luftwaffe had already photographed the “belt” of the south-east of England, and the Italian aircraft were used in the forces for just one day, the 11th of November 1940, when five “Alcione” were sent as “air bait and switch” to lure the hunting of the RAF away from the main objective of the Italian attack on the port of Harwich led by ten Fiat BR.20.
