[9]In one of these flights was a guest on board the then us ambassador, Robert Johnson Underwood; on this occasion, the Roma came to fly over Naples and the island of Capri.The first flight to the United States took place on the 15th November, 1921, from the base of Langley in Virginia.
[10]After test flights, the performance obtained with the 6 engines and Ansaldo were deemed unsatisfactory.
[11]It was thought then to replace the original engines with more powerful Liberty engines.
[12]As a further motivation was given some unreliability in the engines by Ansaldo.The first flight with the new configuration engine came on 21 February 1922, always from the base of Langley.
[13]Aboard there were 45 persons, including some civil engineering.
[14]During the flight it reached a speed of about 90 km/h, but at 14:19 and the nose of the airship collapsed.
[16]Near the base of Norfolk, and now next to the ground, the aircraft struck a high-voltage line.
[17]The contact with the cables, and the hydrogen caught fire, causing an instant explosion.
[18]There were only 11 survivors, severely injured from the fire.The cause could be due to the installation of the new engines, but the investigation which followed the event not reported specific causes.This incident, followed a few months later by that of the airship for the british R38, destined for the United States navy as ZR-2, and caused the United States to reconsider the use of hydrogen.
