[12]Only in the summer of 1933 it was possible to start the construction of the airship W6, the airship of the same type of the Norge and Italia.These difficulties derived from the fact that in the Soviet Union rarely similar projects could be entrusted to the responsibility of a stranger.
[11]Then Nobile was transferred the training of crews and technicians for the new airships.

[10]At the beginning it faced several obstacles: the establishment of the aeronautical was nothing more than a hangar for airships without mechanical workshops and materials.
[9]In addition, the eventual success of the Noble abroad, he could perhaps be useful for propaganda purposes.Umberto Nobile reached Moscow in may 1932.
[11]Then Nobile was transferred the training of crews and technicians for the new airships.

[19]RecordTutti airships made by Noble during his stay in the USSR between 1932 and 1936, were intended to transport passengers.
[20]The USSR W6 was intended to cover the route between Moscow and Swerdlowsk, but this location lacked a hangar for airships, naval mooring, and the ability to refuel the airship gas.
[21]Only in 1936 was prepared to Swerdlowsk a pylon mooring.In 1937, under the command of captain Pankow, of the airship W6 was the protagonist of a record that remained unbeaten for 20 years.
[23]The flight took place from 29 September to 4 October starting from the village of Dolgoprudnoi (Долгопрудной).

[26]On march 4, 1957, the blimp ZPG-2 Snow bird beat this record by flying round-trip on the Atlantic Ocean crossing in 11 days, 15 205 km.These trips served as a preparation for the regular service.
[24]The distance covered was overall of about 5 000 km.

[32]The official version of the incident shows that the map used ("pre-revolutionary") was wrong, lowering the places for the misfortune of 30 m above the sea level.
[33]An unofficial version says instead that the crew was told to be wary of the old maps; because of the poor visibility, the commander Nikolai Gudovantsev ordered him to bring the airship up to 800 m of altitude, but the commander-in-second-Iwan Pankow spent much time to perform the maneuver, probably for fear of losing the orientation due to lack of visibility.

[34]Then the airship came in the vicinity of mount still at the altitude of 300 m.The dirigibilisti of the USSR W6 "OSOAVIAKHIM", are buried in the cemetery of Nowodewichi in Moscow.
[35]The researchers were stuck on the ice were, however, relief from the ice pick.
[36]This incident was also the end of the soviet program for large airships.In 1968, at the site of the accident on the mountain Neblo, where they still had the remains of the airship, was placed a monument by the authorities and the local schools.
