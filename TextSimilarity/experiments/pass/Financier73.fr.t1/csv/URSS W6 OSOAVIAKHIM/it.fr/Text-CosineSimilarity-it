[7]The engineer and dirigibilista had fallen into disgrace in the eyes of fascism after the disaster of the airship "Italy" in Italy the investments in this sector of the airships had been reduced already by the time of the shipment of the "Norge" because the Secretary of State for the Regia Aeronautica: Italo Balbo, had preferred to concentrate the productive efforts in the field of heavier-than-air.
[8]Then the soviet proposal represented an opportunity both for the Noble and for the fascism that he was able to move a character now inconvenient for their air force.
[9]In addition, the eventual success of the Noble abroad, he could perhaps be useful for propaganda purposes.Umberto Nobile reached Moscow in may 1932.
[10]At the beginning it faced several obstacles: the establishment of the aeronautical was nothing more than a hangar for airships without mechanical workshops and materials.
[11]Then Nobile was transferred the training of crews and technicians for the new airships.
[12]Only in the summer of 1933 it was possible to start the construction of the airship W6, the airship of the same type of the Norge and Italia.These difficulties derived from the fact that in the Soviet Union rarely similar projects could be entrusted to the responsibility of a stranger.
[13]No matter Noble the soviet engineers had built an airship semirigid, which was completed in August 1934 received the designation W7.
[14]The airship was destroyed a few days after the completion of a fire in the hangar.
[11]Then Nobile was transferred the training of crews and technicians for the new airships.
[15](According to another source, the airship W7 was a joint project of the Noble, Felice Trojani, and Katanski, and had a volume of 38 000 m3).

[32]The official version of the incident shows that the map used ("pre-revolutionary") was wrong, lowering the places for the misfortune of 30 m above the sea level.
[33]An unofficial version says instead that the crew was told to be wary of the old maps; because of the poor visibility, the commander Nikolai Gudovantsev ordered him to bring the airship up to 800 m of altitude, but the commander-in-second-Iwan Pankow spent much time to perform the maneuver, probably for fear of losing the orientation due to lack of visibility.
