The Fiat A. 80 RC.41 "Nembo" (dt. "Nimbus") was an air-cooled 18-cylinder double-star engine, which was produced by the Italian Fiat Aviazione in the 1930s, and several of the flight of the pre-war time witnesses to the end of the Second world war use.
The development of the engine Fiat A. 80 was developed in 1935 by Tranquillo Zerbi and Antonio Fessia the same time with the Fiat A. 74. Both types were conceptually derived from the US-American engines, with the Fiat, the manufacturing license was acquired. This was the 9-cylinder radial engine Pratt & Whitney R-1690, has been developed for the A. 80 and the 14-cylinder double radial engine R-1830, from which the A. 74. The output structures were changed constructively greatly simplify both the production as well as available materials.The A. 80 was a witness for use in bombs and transport aircraft, as well as for civilian use, while the A. 74 was provided with a smaller diameter for use in fighter aircraft.The Motor A. 80 was on 10. November 1937, after passing the examination for the production admitted, after he had gone through the usual 150-hour test runs on the test bench.
Under the operating conditions during the war fuels with lower quality, and only available to, and including, the engine suffered, despite the numerous Changes during the production and what earned him a lower reliability than his "little brother".
Among the Italian pilots of the A. 80 had a bad reputation â€“ strangely were no complaints from the pilots in the Imperial Japanese army during the second Sino-Japanese war bombers Fiat BR.20 flew.
