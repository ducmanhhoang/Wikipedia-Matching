The Keel of the airship Roma was built in the vicinity of Rome under the Italian airship designer Umberto Nobile, in collaboration with Celestino Usuelli (1877-1926), Gaetano Arturo Crocco, and Eugenio Prassone and was bought in 1921 by the air forces of the U.S. army (at that time US Army Air Service) for 165.000 US dollars. The official building name was 18-M, however, it was during the construction of in-house T-34. The 34 stand for a boost of about 34 tons.Before delivery in the United States had been made near Rome, various test drives. When the American Ambassador, Robert Johnson Underwood was on Board. After that, the ship was disassembled again and transported to America.After the commissioning of the original Ansaldo engines were replaced by Liberty-L12 engine. Allegedly, the Italian engines were too unreliable. The first ride with the new engines took place on 21. February 1922 the Langley Field (Virginia). Here, 45 people were on Board, including seven civilian technicians. During the flight, the nose collapsed structure. Whether the increased motorization was a reason for this, is unclear. The damage led to the failure of the Elevator. Unable to control the air lost ship at altitude and landed in the vicinity of the Norfolk army base to a high-voltage line. When in contact with the cables hydrogen gas caught fire. Only eleven people survived, some of them badly injured, the fire.This misfortune led to the departure of the American forces of hydrogen. The airship ZR-1 USS Shenandoah was filled as the first large airship with Helium.The Roma should originally be in the new balloon and airship school at Brooks Air force airfield stationed. You reached your planned base. Specially for you a 8500 m2 large air-ship hall had been built.A Ansaldo-Motor can still be visited today in the U.S. air force Museum on the Wright-Patterson air force base in Ohio, USA.
