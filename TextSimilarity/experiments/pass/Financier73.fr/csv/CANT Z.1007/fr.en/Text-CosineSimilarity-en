[90]The "Alcione" received its baptism of fire on 29 August 1940, when a formation of 10 CANT Z.1007bis monoderiva of 106° Gruppo bombed Luqa airfield.
[91]The 106°, based on Chinisia, Trapani, in Sicily, was soon joined by the whole 47° Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre with 33 aircraft.
[92]When the war with Greece broke out, the 47° was moved onto that front.
[93]The CANT Z. came back on Malta in 1941, with 9° Stormo Bombardamento terrestre, still based on Chinisia, with 29° and 33° Gruppo, equipped with 25 "Alcione".
[95]The Italian units were joined by Luftwaffe II Fliegerkorp, but when the German aircraft were moved to North Africa, the CANT bombing missions on Malta were reduced.
[96]The Italian bombers had to face the strengthened defences of the island, which employed radar combined with Bristol Beaufighter night fighters.
[97]The "Alcione" started a third wave of night attacks on Malta between 10 and 20 October 1942.
[99]Battle of BritainThe Z.1007 saw action during the later stages of the Battle of Britain from November 1940 to January 1941.
[100]The Regia Aereonautica sent six Z.1007Bis of the 172a Squadriglia to Belgium in the strategic reconnaissance role for the Corpo Aereo Italiano.
[102]They were used in force only once, on 11 November 1940, when five were used as a decoy (without bombs or guns) to draw RAF fighters away from the main Italian attack on a convoy and the port facilities around Harwich by 10 Fiat BR 20 bombers.
