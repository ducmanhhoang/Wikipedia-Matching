[79]As part of Italian and German efforts to stop the British operation Pedestal convoy to re-supply Malta in August 1942, a few Z.1007 Alciones of 51° Gruppo Autonomo based in Alghero, Sardinia, flew reconnaissance missions on the convoy between bombing and raids.
[80]Only on 14 August, at the end of that "Mid-August Battle", three Z.1007bis  bombed the convoy from high altitude.De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 38.

[90]The "Alcione" received its baptism of fire on 29 August 1940, when a formation of 10 CANT Z.1007bis monoderiva of 106° Gruppo bombed Luqa airfield.
[91]The 106°, based on Chinisia, Trapani, in Sicily, was soon joined by the whole 47° Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre with 33 aircraft.
[92]When the war with Greece broke out, the 47° was moved onto that front.
[93]The CANT Z. came back on Malta in 1941, with 9° Stormo Bombardamento terrestre, still based on Chinisia, with 29° and 33° Gruppo, equipped with 25 "Alcione".
[94]The 9° was later joined by 50° Gruppo, based on Sciacca.
[96]The Italian bombers had to face the strengthened defences of the island, which employed radar combined with Bristol Beaufighter night fighters.
[97]The "Alcione" started a third wave of night attacks on Malta between 10 and 20 October 1942.
[98]The 9° Stormo and the 8° Gruppo of 43° Stormo had on line 30 CANT but only 12 were operational.
[99]Battle of BritainThe Z.1007 saw action during the later stages of the Battle of Britain from November 1940 to January 1941.
[100]The Regia Aereonautica sent six Z.1007Bis of the 172a Squadriglia to Belgium in the strategic reconnaissance role for the Corpo Aereo Italiano.
[102]They were used in force only once, on 11 November 1940, when five were used as a decoy (without bombs or guns) to draw RAF fighters away from the main Italian attack on a convoy and the port facilities around Harwich by 10 Fiat BR 20 bombers.
[104]No Z.1007s were lost over Britain, although one of the six originally sent was lost in September on the ferry flight to its base in Belgium.
[105]Greco-Italian WarDuring the invasion of Greece, the Regia Aeronautica deployed the largest number of CANT.Zs.
[106]On 28 October 1940, first day of invasion, 47° Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre (based on Grottaglie airfield) and 50° Gruppo of 50° Stormo (based on Brindisi airfield) had on line 44 Alcione.

[109]During January 1941, 41° Gruppo was replaced by 95° Gruppo of 35° Stormo.
[111]The heavy rains damaged it, forcing continuous repairs by the ground crews.De Marchi e Tonizzo 1994, p. 38.
[112]YugoslaviaThe CANTs opened hostilities against Yugoslavia, on 6 April 1941, bombing Mostar airfield.
[113]During that short invasion, Regia Aeronautica deployed 49 CANT.
