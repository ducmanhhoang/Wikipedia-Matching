[1]The CANT Z. 1007 Alcione was a medium bomber three-engined low-wing developed by the aeronautics division of the Italian company, Cantieri Riuniti dell Adriatico in the thirties and product, as well as, also on license from other national companies.Designed by ingegner Filippo Zappata, the chief designer of the company and the author of numerous aircraft such as the CANT Z. 506 .
[3]and is considered by many authors as the "best bomber in the Italian of the second world war," although its wooden structure could be easily damaged by extreme climatic conditions, such as those encountered in north Africa and in the Soviet Union.
[2]it was characterized by the wooden structure, "excellent flying qualities and good stability" .
[4]During the conflict was mainly used by the Regia Aeronautica, the Italian air force of the period, and then, after the events following the signing of the armistice of Cassibile by the air force Cobelligerante Italian, air force, National Republican, and the Luftwaffe.

[22]Once the structure is completed, among the various currents were inserted wooden forms that competed to create a smooth surface on which was lying the coating consists of wooden slats glued to forty-five degrees on the structure and crossed at ninety degrees from one layer of lamellae to another.It is evident that a similar procedure was extremely slow and therefore does not allow for a high production rate, was also not executable by all companies in the aeronautic, in fact, in addition to the CRDA only the IMAM and, in the course of 1943, the Piaggio built aircraft.The CANT Z. 1007bis-series were produced with the tail vertical tail in two different versions (the two versions are not generally considered to be variations): War mondialeQuando Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940, the Regia Aeronautica had only two Flocks equipped with the "Alcione".
[23]One was the 16th, with 31 aircraft, provided, however, engines, Isotta Fraschini, and therefore declared "war".

[30]During the "battle of half August" to stop the convoy Pedestal, en route to Malta in August 1942, only a few Z. 1007 Alcione of the 51st Gruppo Autonomo based in Alghero, in Sardinia, he carried out missions of reconnaissance on the convoy.
[31]Only on the 14th of August, at the end of the battle, three 1007bis bombed from high altitude, the enemy ships.
[32]During that battle, a CANT specially modified by means of an apparatus of radio-guide created by the general Ferdinando Raffaelli, would have had to drive a SIAI Marchetti S. M. 79 ARP (Aircraft Radio Controlled), without crew and armament, but the explosive cargo, as a "flying bomb" against the convoy.

[36]MaltaL'"Alcione" had its baptism of fire on 29 August 1940, when a formation of ten CANT Z. 1007 bis monoderiva of the 106º Group bombed the airport of Luqa.
[37]The 106º, based on Chinisia, Trapani, in Sicily, was soon joined by the entire 47º Stormo Bombardment of the Earth with a total availability of 33 aircraft.
[38]When the war broke out with Greece, the 47º was moved on that front.
[39]The CANT Z. came back on Malta in 1941, with the 9º Stormo Bombardment of the terrestrial, with the 29th and 33rd Gruppo, equipped with 25 "Alcione".
[40]The 9th was later joined by the 50th Group, based in Sciacca.
[41]The two Italian units-were accompanied by the II Fliegerkorps of the Luftwaffe, but when the German planes were transferred to north Africa, bombing missions over Malta of the CANT were reduced, also because the bombers were cope with the enhanced air defense of the island, which employed the radar combined with the night fighter Bristol Beaufighter.
[42]The "Alcione", began a third wave of bombing on Malta, between 10 and 20 October 1942.
[43]The 9th Squadron and the 8th Group of the 43rd Stormo had on line 30 CANT but only 12 were operational.
[44]The battle of InghilterraI Z. 1007, were also used during the last stages of the Battle of britain from November 1940 to January 1941.
[45]The Regia Aeronautica sent six Z. 1007Bis of the 172ª Squadron in Belgium as a reconnaissance aircraft for the Airplane Body Italian.
[46]But when the aircraft reached its base, to September, the command realized the Luftwaffe had already photographed the “belt” of the south-east of England, and the Italian aircraft were used in the forces for just one day, the 11th of November 1940, when five “Alcione” were sent as “air bait and switch” to lure the hunting of the RAF away from the main objective of the Italian attack on the port of Harwich led by ten Fiat BR.20.
[47]The plan failed but no-one Z. 1007 was shot down over England, although one of the six originally sent was lost during the trip to transfer in based in Belgium, in September 1940.
[48]The war Greek-ItalianaDurante the invasion of Greece, the Regia Aeronautica deployed the largest number of CANT.
[49]Z. on The 28th of October 1940, the first day of the invasion, the 47º Stormo Bombardment of the Earth (based on the airport of Grottaglie) and the 50th Group of the 50th Stormo (based on Brindisi airport) had on line 44 Alcione.

[51]In this campaign, the Flocks suffered a few losses, and during January 1941, the 41st Group was replaced by the 95 th Group of the 35th Squadron.
[52]But it was precisely in this theater of operations that, due to torrential rain, proved to be the weaknesses of the wood structure, which forced to make continuous adjustments and tightening which reduced the efficiency of the aircraft.
[53]JugoslaviaI CANT opened the hostilities against Yugoslavia, 6 April 1941, bombing of the Mostar airport.
[54]During that short invasion, the Regia Aeronautica deployed 49 CANT.
[55]ZBis, 26 of 47º Stormo, 15 of the 95 th Group (the 35th Wing), and eight of the 50th Group (of the 16th Stormo).
