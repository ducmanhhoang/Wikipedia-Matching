[14]When Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940 the Regia Aeronautica had two stormi (squadrons) equipped with the first series of the CANT Z. 1007 and a squadron that had just received the fixtures of the second series, where the pilots were in training.
[12]From 1942, it was already almost obsolete compared to competitors whose the CANT Z. 1018 Leone.
[11]It was a plane fast and reliable but required a maintenance delicate because of its structure partly of wood.

[55]The CANT Z. 1007 was a plane monoplane trimoteur wing average.
[56]His lines are very fluid left no room to imagine a technicality of high-rise construction and complex.

[15]The CANT Z. 1007bis was used as a bomber during the war italo-Greek, in the Aegean Sea in 1941, with which the 210ª Squadron Italian, sank the destroyer HMS Juno (F46) of the Royal Navy.
[16]Its use in northern Africa Italian territory corresponding very roughly to the Libya current, proved to be more difficult because of a maintenance irregular and high temperatures at the soil.
[17]During the war of England, it was used as a reconnaissance aircraft in the autumn of 1940.
[18]From 1943 onwards, thanks to the low noise of its engines, it will be reserved for missions night.On January 28, 1941, a patrol of ten Alcione had to face on two occasions, ten and twelve biplanes Gloster Gladiator of the Royal Air Force in Malta.
[20]During the "battle of mid-August", to stop the convoy Pedestal, en route to Malta in August 1942, two Z. 1007 Alcione 51st Autonomous Group based in Alghero, in Sardinia, will carry out reconnaissance missions on the convoy.
[21]This is only on 14 August that three CANT Z. 1007bis bombarded the enemy ships.
[22]During this intervention, a CANT specially equipped with a radio device guide invented by general Ferdinando Raffaelli, had to fly to remote a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 ARP (Aircraft rf), unmanned and packed with explosives, as a "flying bomb" against the convoy.
[23]The mission failed because of a trivial failure radio.
[24]After the Armistice of Cassibile devices based in the south have been assigned to squadrons during the night to supply the Italian units of the Balkans, especially the yugoslav partisans.
[25]The CANT Z. 1007bis based in the north were assigned to the 1st Squadra di Bombardamento "Ettore Muti" of the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana, for the training of pilots.
[26]MalteL'"Alcione" had its 1st baptism of fire on 29 August 1940, lorsq'a training of ten CANT Z. 1007bis 1st series of the 106º Group bombarded the airport of Luqa in Malta.
[27]The 106º group, based in Trapani, Sicily was quickly seconded by the "47º Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre" and its 33 aircraft.
[28]When war was declared with germany, Greece, the 47º Stormo was moved to this new front.
[29]The CANT Z. 1007 returned to Malta in 1941, with the "9º Stormo Bombardamento terrestre", with 25 "Alcione".
[31]The 12 Italian aircraft had to face a tough defence of the island by the british forces and its fighter Bristol Beaufighter.
[32]The CANT Z. 1007bis Alcione carried out a third mission of bombing on Malta, from 10 to 20 October 1942 without losing an aircraft.
[33]Battle of AngleterreLes aircraft, CANT Z. 1007bis have also been used in the last phase of the Battle of britain in November 1940 to January 1941.
[34]The Regia Aeronautica deployed six Z. 1007Bis" of the 172ª Squadron based in Belgium in recognition of the Corpo Aereo Italiano.
[36]Enjoying some of this "joke" command in Italian only took part in one other operation with the Luftwaffe, on November 11, 1940, with five “Alcione”, which served as a bait to draw the hunters of the RAF away from the main objective, which was the bombing of the Italian on the port of Harwich made with ten bombers Fiat BR.20.

[41]In January 1941, the 41º Group" has been replaced by the "95º Group of 35 Stormo".
[42]However, the torrential rains that beat down, revealed the weak points of the struttura in partially of wood of this type of device, which required the mechanics to check permanently the settings and applications that were likely to interfere with the proper guiding of the aircraft.
[43]YougoslavieLes CANT Z. 1007 commence hostilities against Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 by bombarding the airport of Mostar.
[44]During this invasion, the Regia Aeronautica used 49 CANT Z1007bis.
