[16]The first specimens of series entered in service in 1940.
[18]In 1942, there was now exceeded, but the programs for the series production of the aircraft intended to replace it, including the CANT Z. 1018 Leone, was delayed and was finally stopped with the armistice.
[17]LAlcione, so it was christened, was an airplane fast and reliable, but suffered a hard-working maintenance and tuning, due to the structure of the wood.

[20]The construction was completely made of wood, this solution influenced both the rate of production – the construction was extremely complex – that on the use the operating.

[25]The CANT Z. 1007bis was intended as a bomber on the Greek front, in the Aegean in 1941 the 210ª Squadron sank the destroyers of the Royal Navy HMS Juno), and over the whole mediterranean zone.
[26]Use in north Africa proved to be difficult due to the difficulty of maintenance under high temperature, as well as to the limits of tactical aircraft in the exchequer.
[27]On the Sleeve, and worked as a scout in the autumn of 1940.
[28]In 1943 they were removed from the first line and for night missions, with slight changes to the exhaust systems of the engines.On January 28, 1941, ten Alcione was addressed two times, the first by a formation of ten hunting and the second from one of the twelve, are both made up of biplanes Gloster Gladiator.
[30]During the "battle of half August" to stop the convoy Pedestal, en route to Malta in August 1942, only a few Z. 1007 Alcione of the 51st Gruppo Autonomo based in Alghero, in Sardinia, he carried out missions of reconnaissance on the convoy.
[31]Only on the 14th of August, at the end of the battle, three 1007bis bombed from high altitude, the enemy ships.
[32]During that battle, a CANT specially modified by means of an apparatus of radio-guide created by the general Ferdinando Raffaelli, would have had to drive a SIAI Marchetti S. M. 79 ARP (Aircraft Radio Controlled), without crew and armament, but the explosive cargo, as a "flying bomb" against the convoy.
[33]But the mission failed due to a trivial technical problem and was not retried.
[34]After the armistice, the appliances recovered in the south were framed in the Flock at Night and used to aviolanci of weapons and golden crops, so the Italian units still operating in the Balkans and the yugoslavian partisans.
[35]The CANT Z. 1007bis remained in the north were reorganized into the 1st Team Bombing "Ettore Muti", air force National Republican, the department that carried out activities other than training.
[36]MaltaL'"Alcione" had its baptism of fire on 29 August 1940, when a formation of ten CANT Z. 1007 bis monoderiva of the 106º Group bombed the airport of Luqa.
[37]The 106º, based on Chinisia, Trapani, in Sicily, was soon joined by the entire 47º Stormo Bombardment of the Earth with a total availability of 33 aircraft.
[38]When the war broke out with Greece, the 47º was moved on that front.
[39]The CANT Z. came back on Malta in 1941, with the 9º Stormo Bombardment of the terrestrial, with the 29th and 33rd Gruppo, equipped with 25 "Alcione".
[41]The two Italian units-were accompanied by the II Fliegerkorps of the Luftwaffe, but when the German planes were transferred to north Africa, bombing missions over Malta of the CANT were reduced, also because the bombers were cope with the enhanced air defense of the island, which employed the radar combined with the night fighter Bristol Beaufighter.
[42]The "Alcione", began a third wave of bombing on Malta, between 10 and 20 October 1942.
[44]The battle of InghilterraI Z. 1007, were also used during the last stages of the Battle of britain from November 1940 to January 1941.
[45]The Regia Aeronautica sent six Z. 1007Bis of the 172ª Squadron in Belgium as a reconnaissance aircraft for the Airplane Body Italian.
[46]But when the aircraft reached its base, to September, the command realized the Luftwaffe had already photographed the “belt” of the south-east of England, and the Italian aircraft were used in the forces for just one day, the 11th of November 1940, when five “Alcione” were sent as “air bait and switch” to lure the hunting of the RAF away from the main objective of the Italian attack on the port of Harwich led by ten Fiat BR.20.

[51]In this campaign, the Flocks suffered a few losses, and during January 1941, the 41st Group was replaced by the 95 th Group of the 35th Squadron.
[52]But it was precisely in this theater of operations that, due to torrential rain, proved to be the weaknesses of the wood structure, which forced to make continuous adjustments and tightening which reduced the efficiency of the aircraft.
[53]JugoslaviaI CANT opened the hostilities against Yugoslavia, 6 April 1941, bombing of the Mostar airport.
[54]During that short invasion, the Regia Aeronautica deployed 49 CANT.
