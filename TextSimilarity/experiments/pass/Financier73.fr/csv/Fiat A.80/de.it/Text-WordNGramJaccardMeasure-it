[1]The Fiat A. 80 RC.41 "Nembo" was a aeronautical engine radial 18-cylinder double star, air-cooled, developed by the Italian company Fiat Aviation in the thirties and used in many aircraft, starting from the pre-war period up to the end of the second world war.
[2]ProgettazioneIl engine Fiat A. 80 was designed in 1935 by the Quiet Zerbi and Antonio Fessia, at the same time the Fiat A. 74.
[3]Both were conceptually derived from the us models (to A. 80, the Pratt & Whitney R-1690 single-star and R-1830 double star 14 cylinder engine) of the Fiat had acquired the license of construction, but with numerous differences in design (for example in the measurements of bore and stroke) and construction.
[5]The A. 80 was intended to be designed for use on bombers and fighter planes, transport civilians, while the A. 74, of smaller diameter, was designed for use on hunting.The engine was certified on November 10, 1937, after having passed the usual test run for a cycle of 150 consecutive hours on the test bench.
[6]In operating conditions, however, having to use fuel of poor quality available in time of war, despite the many changes in the course of the production, he suffered a reliability less than the "little brother".
[7]This made him earn a bad reputation among the Italian drivers (curiously, not are complaints, in this sense, among the pilots of the japanese imperial Army, which was used by the bombers Fiat B. R. 20 during the Second sino-japanese war).
