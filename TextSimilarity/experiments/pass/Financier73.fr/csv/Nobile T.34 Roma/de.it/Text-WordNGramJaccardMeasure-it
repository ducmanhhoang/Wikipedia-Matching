[8]Subsequently, it was referred to as the T-34 because the lifting capacity of the airship was about 34 tons.Before being disassembled to be moved via ship to the United States, the airship made several test flights, mainly in the surroundings of Rome.
[9]In one of these flights was a guest on board the then us ambassador, Robert Johnson Underwood; on this occasion, the Roma came to fly over Naples and the island of Capri.The first flight to the United States took place on the 15th November, 1921, from the base of Langley in Virginia.
[11]It was thought then to replace the original engines with more powerful Liberty engines.

[12]As a further motivation was given some unreliability in the engines by Ansaldo.The first flight with the new configuration engine came on 21 February 1922, always from the base of Langley.
[13]Aboard there were 45 persons, including some civil engineering.
[14]During the flight it reached a speed of about 90 km/h, but at 14:19 and the nose of the airship collapsed.
[15]The damage led to the loss of the rudder of altitude, making the Rome ungovernable, and incapable of resuming.
[16]Near the base of Norfolk, and now next to the ground, the aircraft struck a high-voltage line.
[17]The contact with the cables, and the hydrogen caught fire, causing an instant explosion.
[19]For the airship hard in the final stages of completion at Lakehurst, the ZR-1 "Shenandoah", was then adopted helium.The airship Roma was originally intended to be the basis of Brooks, situated in the outskirts of San Antonio, Texas, the headquarters of a foundation and a school for observers in aircraft of the army.
[20]For Roma had been set up a new hangar that was finally demolished in the early 1940's, when the airships had lost importance as a reconnaissance aircraft.At the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at the air base Wright-Patterson, is still one of the motors Ansaldo originally installed on the airship Roma.
