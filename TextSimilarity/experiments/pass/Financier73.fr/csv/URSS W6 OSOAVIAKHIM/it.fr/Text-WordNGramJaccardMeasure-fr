[1]The W6 OSOAVIAKHIM is an airship semi-rigid built in the USSR and designed by the aeronautical engineer Italian Umberto Nobile.
[2]The name of the aircraft was borrowed from the name of the establishment where it was manufactured : "the Society for the promotion of defence, aviation and chemistry" (in Russian ОСОАВИАХИМ).
[3]The airship W6 was the biggest airship ever built in the Soviet Union, and this will be the one that will have the greatest success.

[7]HistoireA the end of the 1920s, the young Soviet Union" is very interested in the exploits of the great airships such as the Nobile N. 1 Norge and LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin.
[9]The engineer had been dishonoured, in the eyes of fascism, after the disaster of the airship Nobile N. 2 Italia when returning from his 3rd expedition to the North Pole in 1928.
[11]The Russian proposal was the perfect opportunity for Nobile to improve its image and to the leader fascist who could temporarily exclude a character annoying for its air force.
[12]Also a possible success of Nobile abroad could also be useful for propaganda purposes.Umberto Nobile comes to Moscow in may 1932.
[13]At the beginning, he must face several difficulties : the aircraft factory was nothing more than a simple hangar for dirigibles-free workshops and tooling mechanics.
[14]Nobile has in advance ensure the training of crews and technicians for the construction of new airships.
[15]It was not until the summer of 1933 it was possible to begin the construction of the airship W6, aircraft in all points similar to the Nobile N. 1 Norge and Nobile N. 2 Italia.These difficulties seem to have stemmed from the fact that in the Soviet Union, never the direction and responsibility of projects of such importance have been entrusted to a stranger.
[16]The soviet engineers had built earlier airship-semi-rigid 9150 m3, which was completed in August 1934 W7 receive the designation.
[17]The airship was destroyed a few days after the end of a fire shed.
[18](According to another source the W7 airship was a joint project of Nobile, Felice Trojani, and Katanski, and had a volume of 38 000 m3 The exploitationPendant the duration of his stay in the Soviet Union from 1931 to 1936, Umberto Nobile designed airships for the transportation of passengers.

[21]In 1936, a mast mooring has finally been erected in Sverdlovsk.In 1937, captain Pankow led the W6 during 79 hours on the route Moscow-Sverdlovsk-Moscow with the continuous operation of the engines.
[23]The race record began in Dolgoproudny (Russian Долгопрудный) on 29 September and ended on 4 October.
[24]The distance was about 5,000 km.
[25]This trip was the preparation of a regular link in the airship.
[26]The catastropheLe February 5, 1938, at 16h45, a group of explorers and researchers soviets, led by Ivan Papanin, was surprised by sudden movements of the drifting ice in the Arctic.
[28]The expedition is part of the city of Murmansk.
[29]The journey between Moscow and Murmansk should allow to check the good behavior of the aircraft in arctic climate conditions.
[31]According to the official version, the data contained on the card-board mentioned in the obstacle to only 30 m above sea level.
[32]The survivors would have however reported that the Commander Nikolai Gudowanzew was well wary of the data from the previous maps and, because of the poor visibility ambient, he had given the order to sail to 800 meters of altitude, but Ivan Pankow, the second in command, had put too much time before retransmitting this order, and the balloon stayed at an altitude of 300 m. On the 19 people on board 13 were killed in the cabin, three others were injured.FliegerRevue Januar 2010, S. 54-55, Die gescheiterte Rettungsfahrt The victims are buried in the [[graveyard of Novodevitchi]) in Moscow.
[30]During this trip, the airship collided with the "Mont Neblo" (in Russian Небло), near the town of Kandalaksha, mount peaking at only 440 m altitude.
[33]The researchers of the expedition were rescued by icebreakers.
[34]This accident put an end to the soviet program of the great airships.In 1968, on the mountain Neblo, to the place where the airship crashed, the students and the local authorities have erected a monument next to the remains of the accident.
