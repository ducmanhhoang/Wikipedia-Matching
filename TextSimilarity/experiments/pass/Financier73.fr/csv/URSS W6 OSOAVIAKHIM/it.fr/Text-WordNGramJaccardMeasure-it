[1]The soviet W6 OSOAVIAKHIM was an airship semi-rigid made in the Soviet Union on the project of the Italian engineer Umberto Nobile.
[2]The name was derived from the Society for the promotion of defense, aviation and chemistry (in Russian ОСОАВИАХИМ).
[3]The W6 was the largest airship built in the Soviet Union and the most successful, having, in October 1937, won the record of the flight continued for an airship.

[6]The origins of the progettoNegli twenty years the interest towards the achievements of the great airships, such as the LZ127 “Graf Zeppelin” and the Norge, had led to the emergence in the Soviet Union will develop its own national programme.
[7]The engineer and dirigibilista had fallen into disgrace in the eyes of fascism after the disaster of the airship "Italy" in Italy the investments in this sector of the airships had been reduced already by the time of the shipment of the "Norge" because the Secretary of State for the Regia Aeronautica: Italo Balbo, had preferred to concentrate the productive efforts in the field of heavier-than-air.
[8]Then the soviet proposal represented an opportunity both for the Noble and for the fascism that he was able to move a character now inconvenient for their air force.
[9]In addition, the eventual success of the Noble abroad, he could perhaps be useful for propaganda purposes.Umberto Nobile reached Moscow in may 1932.
[10]At the beginning it faced several obstacles: the establishment of the aeronautical was nothing more than a hangar for airships without mechanical workshops and materials.
[11]Then Nobile was transferred the training of crews and technicians for the new airships.
[12]Only in the summer of 1933 it was possible to start the construction of the airship W6, the airship of the same type of the Norge and Italia.These difficulties derived from the fact that in the Soviet Union rarely similar projects could be entrusted to the responsibility of a stranger.
[13]No matter Noble the soviet engineers had built an airship semirigid, which was completed in August 1934 received the designation W7.
[14]The airship was destroyed a few days after the completion of a fire in the hangar.
[15](According to another source, the airship W7 was a joint project of the Noble, Felice Trojani, and Katanski, and had a volume of 38 000 m3).

[21]Only in 1936 was prepared to Swerdlowsk a pylon mooring.In 1937, under the command of captain Pankow, of the airship W6 was the protagonist of a record that remained unbeaten for 20 years.
[23]The flight took place from 29 September to 4 October starting from the village of Dolgoprudnoi (Долгопрудной).
[24]The distance covered was overall of about 5 000 km.
[26]On march 4, 1957, the blimp ZPG-2 Snow bird beat this record by flying round-trip on the Atlantic Ocean crossing in 11 days, 15 205 km.These trips served as a preparation for the regular service.
[28]In February of 1938 a group of arctic explorers soviets, he was surprised by the movements of the ice, remaining trapped on the ice floe drifting before being able to reach Greenland.
[30]The operation would be started from the city of Murmansk.
[31]The transfer flight from Moscow to Murmansk it would have also served to test the behavior of the airship in an arctic climate.During the transfer flight, at 16:45 on 5 February, the airship collise with the monte Neblo ("Небло") near Kandalakša at an altitude of 324 m. Of the 19 persons on board of the USSR W6 16 perished in the accident and 3 were injured.
[32]The official version of the incident shows that the map used ("pre-revolutionary") was wrong, lowering the places for the misfortune of 30 m above the sea level.
[33]An unofficial version says instead that the crew was told to be wary of the old maps; because of the poor visibility, the commander Nikolai Gudovantsev ordered him to bring the airship up to 800 m of altitude, but the commander-in-second-Iwan Pankow spent much time to perform the maneuver, probably for fear of losing the orientation due to lack of visibility.
[34]Then the airship came in the vicinity of mount still at the altitude of 300 m.The dirigibilisti of the USSR W6 "OSOAVIAKHIM", are buried in the cemetery of Nowodewichi in Moscow.
[35]The researchers were stuck on the ice were, however, relief from the ice pick.
[36]This incident was also the end of the soviet program for large airships.In 1968, at the site of the accident on the mountain Neblo, where they still had the remains of the airship, was placed a monument by the authorities and the local schools.
