The CANT Z. 1007 Alcione was a plane trimoteur medium bomber to a low wing, developed by the Italian company Cantieri Riuniti dell'adriatico - CRDA in the second half of the 1930s. This aircraft bombardier has, thanks to its versatility, was used in the missions of aerial reconnaissance by the Regia Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe. During the second world war it was widely used on the front Greek, at Malta, and during the war in England.
DéveloppementLes studies began in 1935 under the responsibility of the aerospace engineer Italian Filippo Zappata recognized for the lines extremely clean and slender for his achievements. The principle of powerplant chosen was the trimoteur, typical solution devices italians of that class at the time. The constructor of Trieste presents the prototype in march 1937.The first prototype was equipped with engines, Isotta Fraschini, engine 12 cylinder V 60°, water-cooled power developing 825 Hp each, driving propellers bipales. The Regia Aeronautica passed an order of 34 aircraft, but equipped with bladed propellers with variable pitch.The engine Isotta Fraschini Asso XI of the first series do not give complete satisfaction, the manufacturer opted for the engine Piaggio P. XI R2C 40 14-cylinder star more powerful. It is as well as appears to be the version of CANT Z. 1007bis in 1940. The CANT Z. 1007bis was baptized Alcione - fisherman. It was a plane fast and reliable but required a maintenance delicate because of its structure partly of wood. From 1942, it was already almost obsolete compared to competitors whose the CANT Z. 1018 Leone. These devices have been permanently removed from service the day after the signing of the armistice of Cassibile in September 1943.
When Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940 the Regia Aeronautica had two stormi (squadrons) equipped with the first series of the CANT Z. 1007 and a squadron that had just received the fixtures of the second series, where the pilots were in training.
The CANT Z. 1007bis was used as a bomber during the war italo-Greek, in the Aegean Sea in 1941, with which the 210ª Squadron Italian, sank the destroyer HMS Juno (F46) of the Royal Navy. Its use in northern Africa Italian territory corresponding very roughly to the Libya current, proved to be more difficult because of a maintenance irregular and high temperatures at the soil. During the war of England, it was used as a reconnaissance aircraft in the autumn of 1940. From 1943 onwards, thanks to the low noise of its engines, it will be reserved for missions night.On January 28, 1941, a patrol of ten Alcione had to face on two occasions, ten and twelve biplanes Gloster Gladiator of the Royal Air Force in Malta. The Regia Aeronautica will lose a CANT Z. 1007bis but will bring three hunters british.
During the "battle of mid-August", to stop the convoy Pedestal, en route to Malta in August 1942, two Z. 1007 Alcione 51st Autonomous Group based in Alghero, in Sardinia, will carry out reconnaissance missions on the convoy. This is only on 14 August that three CANT Z. 1007bis bombarded the enemy ships. . During this intervention, a CANT specially equipped with a radio device guide invented by general Ferdinando Raffaelli, had to fly to remote a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 ARP (Aircraft rf), unmanned and packed with explosives, as a "flying bomb" against the convoy. The mission failed because of a trivial failure radio. .After the Armistice of Cassibile devices based in the south have been assigned to squadrons during the night to supply the Italian units of the Balkans, especially the yugoslav partisans. The CANT Z. 1007bis based in the north were assigned to the 1st Squadra di Bombardamento "Ettore Muti" of the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana, for the training of pilots.
MalteL'"Alcione" had its 1st baptism of fire on 29 August 1940, lorsq'a training of ten CANT Z. 1007bis 1st series of the 106º Group bombarded the airport of Luqa in Malta. The 106º group, based in Trapani, Sicily was quickly seconded by the "47º Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre" and its 33 aircraft. When war was declared with germany, Greece, the 47º Stormo was moved to this new front. The CANT Z. 1007 returned to Malta in 1941, with the "9º Stormo Bombardamento terrestre", with 25 "Alcione". .
The two Italian units were reinforced by the Fliegerkorps of the Luftwaffe, who did a very brief stint before being posted to North Africa. The 12 Italian aircraft had to face a tough defence of the island by the british forces and its fighter Bristol Beaufighter. The CANT Z. 1007bis Alcione carried out a third mission of bombing on Malta, from 10 to 20 October 1942 without losing an aircraft.
Battle of AngleterreLes aircraft, CANT Z. 1007bis have also been used in the last phase of the Battle of britain in November 1940 to January 1941. The Regia Aeronautica deployed six Z. 1007Bis" of the 172ª Squadron based in Belgium in recognition of the Corpo Aereo Italiano. My when the planes returned to their base in September, the Luftwaffe confess to have these photographic records and have requested this mission by mistake. Enjoying some of this "joke" command in Italian only took part in one other operation with the Luftwaffe, on November 11, 1940, with five “Alcione”, which served as a bait to draw the hunters of the RAF away from the main objective, which was the bombing of the Italian on the port of Harwich made with ten bombers Fiat BR.20. No aircraft Italian was not damaged during this procedure dangerous.
War Italo-GrecquePendant this conflict, the Regia Aeronautica deployed 44 CANT Z. 1007 from the 28 October 1940, from the first day of the invasion, with the "47º Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre, based at Grottaglie, and the "50º Group of the 50º Stormo, based at Brindisi. On 5 November, those units were reinforced by the "41º Group of 12º Stormo" and its 16 devices. . During this campaign, the aviation Italian is only very little loss. In January 1941, the 41º Group" has been replaced by the "95º Group of 35 Stormo". However, the torrential rains that beat down, revealed the weak points of the struttura in partially of wood of this type of device, which required the mechanics to check permanently the settings and applications that were likely to interfere with the proper guiding of the aircraft.
YougoslavieLes CANT Z. 1007 commence hostilities against Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 by bombarding the airport of Mostar. During this invasion, the Regia Aeronautica used 49 CANT Z1007bis.
Independent state of Croatia =In January 1944 the two squadrons of the "Croatian Luwftwaffen Legion"editor's note : The independent State of Croatia had its military aviation, the "Zrakoplovstvo NDH", which intervenanit on its national territory. The pilot volunteers who fought on the Russian front were integrated into the Luftwaffe as part of the "Croatian Luwftwaffen Legion". Their aircraft bore the signs of the Luftwaffe with the symbol of the Oustachis, crest chequered red and white, surmounted by a "U" on the fuselage., training mixed Croatian-German under German management, were 3 devices Z. 1007bis and 3 Fiat BR.20 to serve as jet training of pilots of bombers.
basic version in 1937 with engines, Isotta Fraschini, 12 cylinders in V at 60°, cooled by water ;a power of 825 Hp each, driving propellers bipales.
improved version in 1940 with engines Piaggio P. XI R2C 40 14-cylinder star the most powerful and-bladed propellers with variable pitch.
prototype d ;plane postal military with engines Piaggio P. XIX RC.35 1,500 Hp. the device flew in 1939 and had ;a range of 3,000 km with a maximum takeoff weight of over 13,600 kg. This prototype has been transformed into plane torpedo bomber.
prototype d ;a variant plane of the Z. 1007, obtained by assembling a cell of Z. 1007 on the floats of the seaplane CANT Z. 506. The device made its first flight in 1940.
The CANT Z. 1007 was a plane monoplane trimoteur wing average. His lines are very fluid left no room to imagine a technicality of high-rise construction and complex. The panels of the fuselage were made of wood laminated built on-site and fixed on the wooden structure of classical appearance. The landing gear was fully retractable.
