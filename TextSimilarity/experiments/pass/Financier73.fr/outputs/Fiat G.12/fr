The aircraft Fiat G. 12 is a transport plane trimoteur low-wing produced by the aircraft manufacturer Italian Fiat Aviazione in the early 1940s.Originally designed as a civilian aircraft, with the outbreak of the second world war, the army of the King of Italy ordered a version adapted for the transportation military tactics for the Regia Aeronautica. At the end of the conflict, its use resumed in the civil transportation by the new national airline, Alitalia.
The contexteDurant between the two world wars, the air connections are experiencing a very strong development. The many Italian companies private, and subsidiary of the Fiat group, Avio Linee Italiane (ALI) were in need of aircraft line able to cross the Alps in safety. The trimoteurs RAIS S. 73 does not have the ceiling enough, they had to rely on the Junkers Ju 52 German powered by engines Piaggio P. XR or Alfa 126. To oppose such competitor, the executive of Fiat told his engineer specialist in aviation Giuseppe Gabrielli the development of a new aircraft, the Fiat G. 12.
The conceptAlors that the twin-engine aircraft had the wind in its sails in the mid-1930s, Italian companies prefer trimoteurs, due primarily to the low-power unit engines are available in the peninsula. Although the engineer Gabrielli has already to his credit the twin-engined Fiat G. 18, the national airline of the era, Ala Littoria, asked expressly for a trimoteur. As well, the engineer he yielded to this requirement and initiates the study of the Fiat G. 12 in 1938, taking into account the experience gained with the G. 18. Ala Littoria ordered as soon as 6 copies of the trimoteur, followed by the company ALI with 8 pieces, which command is to be extended up to 15 devices.The first prototype of the Fiat G. 12C was initiated in 1939. Registered MESSRS. 60649, it made its inaugural flight on October 15, 1940 in the hands of Enrico Rollandi. Several small defects were noted during the first tests : the drift was hard and not effective enough, causing the sheers to take off, and the centering was not correct, which gave the device a natural tendency to pitch nose-up. Despite these little faults of youth, the Regia Aeronautica is showing interest and ordering 21 copies of military specifications, prototype included. The ability of the Fiat G. 12 to operate from short runways and summarily appointed was highly appreciated. With the entry into war of Italy, the airlines came under military control and were incorporated as "Nucs Comunicazioni" (linkage groups). The "Nucleo Comunicazioni ALI" received his first G. 12 in November 1941 and march 1942.In the spring of 1941, the Regia Aeronautica pass a new order of 50 copies of the G. 12 and G. 12T. This version, intended for the army, there had been no changes to the external but had received seat longitudinal accommodating 24 men in the hold. The Fiat G. 12T flew for the first time on 15 may 1941.
The Fiat G. 12 in the étrangerMi-April 1942, a military mission of Hungarian travels in Italy to analyze a Fiat G. 12 to the Fiat factory. On 18 July, a copy of the civil lands in Budaors to be officially presented to the Hungarian authorities. On August 17, Hungary requested the authority to acquire a G. 12T and two G. 12C, a request that will be accepted by the "Comando Supremo" Italian on 12 September 1942. The first copy ordered, MESSRS. 60682, was tested in flight on September 15. A crew hungarians arrived in Turin in October for training on the new device, which will be transferred to Hungary on 21 November with markings Italian. The 30 October and 20 November, Fiat Aviazione address two letters to the aviation ministry for permission to export 11 additional devices. On January 2, 1943, the gen. Giuseppe Casero permits the export of the 11 Fiat G. 12 to Hungary on condition that the deliveries are not involved until the month of April at a rate of 1 to 2 aircraft per month. Before the armistice, a further five aircraft were delivered to Hungary.
Description techniqueLe Fiat G. 12 is, at the origin, a plane of line trimoteur to metal structure capable of flying at high altitude. It is distinguished from the foreign production by its fuselage end and a wing of large area, ensuring a high stability. The fuselage, of rectangular section and rounded on the upper corners, is constructed by 40 of the couples dural gathered by smooth on which the coating also dural is fixed. The cockpit has two seats side-by-side for the drivers, with double command. The dashboard received the instruments for the flight without visibility, namely a goniometer, and a curator in cape town. The mechanic and the radio are placed behind the pilots. The access door to the fuselage is pentagonal in shape. The sides of the fuselage of the G. 12C and T include 6 rectangular windows and a porthole added to the left. On the civil version, the passenger cabin could accommodate 14 people.The Fiat G. 12C is equipped with three engines Fiat A. 74 RC.42 to 9 cylinders in star, developing 840 Hp to the ground at 2400 rpm. The engine drives a propeller Hamilton of 3.35 m diameter regulator not automatic, turn to 1.740 rpm through a gearbox. General overhauls of the engine are scheduled every 200 hours.
The long haul : G. 12 GA, LGA and RTL'wing of the G. 12 was, from the outset, a large volume is not used. It was so easy to increase the carrying fuel to extend the life of the unit by adding four additional tanks in the wings and another ten in the fuselage, bringing the total capacity to carry fuel to 7.590 litres. This renders the device a battery life of up to 4,500 km. Designated Fiat G. 12 GA Gondar (for Autonomy), this version had only a single copy, the MESSRS. 60656 (I-FUGI) which flew for the first time on 30 September 1941, too late to refuel the ultimate point of Italian resistance in Ethiopia.Following this experience, the command of the SAS asked for the realization of three devices, containing 22 tanks each (12 in the wings and 10 in the fuselage), $ 10.090 litres of fuel for a range of 6.000 km. The three aircraft so equipped were the MESSRS. 60663 I-ALII, MESSRS. 60667 I-ALIO and MESSRS. 60668 I-ALIP, designated G. 12 TR GA.To its routes in south america, awaiting the arrival of the Piaggio P. 108 C, he was asked at Fiat Aviazione in the study of a version of the G. 12 powered by the engine of the Alfa Romeo. With Alfa Romeo 126 RC.34, the device could take the 3.060 km separating the island from the Salt (Cape Verde), Recife (Brazil) with a payload of up to 1.630 kg, or the 3.960 km between Villa Cisneros, Morocco) and Natal (Brazil) by limiting the load of 500 kg. However, the Rio conference in January 1942 and put an end to air links to the south american continent. The first G. 12 LGA made its inaugural flight on February 1, 1942, and was certified on April 16. Powered by 3 Alfa 126 RC.34 the actuation of the propellers RAIS-Hydrovaria S. 53, he took 6.740 litres of fuel in 15 tanks and was carrying 9 passengers plus 4 crew men. Two other Fiat G. 12 LGA were used in July 1942 on the line Rome-Seville-Lisbon before being paid to the army.
The Fiat G. 12 after the armisticeLa Luftwaffe seized twenty copies at the time of the armistice. She adjugea then all the Fiat G. 12 out of the Fiat factory, or 5 devices by the end of the year 1943, and the other 8 in 1944. The american bombardment of April 24, 1944 on the Fiat factory is destroyed 8 aircraft G. 12. The number of aircraft Fiat G. 12 in service with the Luftwaffe went from 15 in February 1944 to 18 April and 21 July 1944. Lufthansa took two Fiat G. 12 civilians that were allocated to the registrations D-ASVJ and D-ASVK.
The Fiat G. 12 post-war aftermath of the second world war, five aircraft Fiat G. 12 were still being manufactured at the Fiat factory. On July 11, 1945, the control commission, ally spoke for the completion of these devices by September and the construction of seven new aircraft Fiat G. 12 by February 1946. The first device will be joining the ranks of the Regia Aeronautica in the summer of 1945, and the other 4 in November on the basis of Rome-Centocelle. All of these were equipped with engine Fiat A. 74.The helicopter, registered MM. 60895 equipped with three engines Alfa Romeo 128 RC.18, served as the first prototype to the release G. 12 CA (Civil, engines Alfa), the first model Italian civil after the war. Able to accommodate up to 18 passengers, it stood out through its portholes circular and its drift resumption of the G. 12 RT. On the copy the following built in December 1945, the number of passengers was increased to 20.In 1946, 15 Fiat G. 12 CA and TA (Transportation, engines Alfa) came out of the assembly lines of Fiat Aviazione. In the spring of 1947, the company ALI resumed his connections Milan-Rome with three Fiat G. 12, before yielding to the Aeronautica Militare in the spring of 1948 after the receipt of the Fiat G. 212. In April 1947, Alitalia also received four Fiat G. 12 CA.In the spring of 1947, the company sardinian "Airone" of Cagliari received three copies of an extended version, the Fiat G. 12 L. Powered by the Fiat A. 74, they were remotorisés with Pratt & Whitney R. 1830 developing 1.215 Hp at take-off in 1948. A fourth copy, built with the american engines, was designated the Fiat G. 12 LP.On January 3, 1947, Alitalia ordered five G. 12 LB powered by engines Bristol Pegasus 48, of which the first made its maiden flight on 30 August. In 1950, the five planes were sold to the Aeronautica Militare. The last 4 Fiat G. 12 products between June 1948 and April 1949 were delivered to the Aeronautica Militare. It was G. 12 THE (Long Alfa), powered by motors Alfa 128. The four devices were permitted to assume the cross of Malta as marks of nationality to circumvent article 52 of the treaty of peace, limiting to 150 the number of transport aircraft assigned to the Aeronautica Militare.In total, between 1940 and 1949, a total of 104 aircraft Fiat G. 12 was produced, all versions.
the civilian version (C for Commercial) transport line 14 seats, equipped with 3 radial engines Fiat A. 74 RC.42, 800-Hp (574 kW) each,
the civilian version of line 18 squares, with 3 radial engines Alfa Romeo 128 RC.18 860 Hp (633 kW) each,
the civilian version of row 22 seats, with 3 radial engines Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S1C3-G Twin Wasp of 1.065 Hp (793 kW) each.
