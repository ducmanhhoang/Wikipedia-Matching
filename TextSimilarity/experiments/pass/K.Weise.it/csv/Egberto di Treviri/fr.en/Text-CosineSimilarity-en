[1]Egbert (ca. 950 &ndash; 9 December 993) was the Archbishop of Trier from 977 until his death.
[3]After being trained in the abbey of Egmond and the court of Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne, he became the chancellor of Otto II in 976.
[4]The following year he was appointed to the archdiocese of Trier.
[5]In 984, he joined the conspiracy of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, to dethrone Otto, but the following year returned to the allegiance of Otto.
[7]Egbert himself commissioned the Registrum Gregorii.
[8]He was also the recipient of the early Romanesque illustrated Codex Egberti, which was probably produced at Reichenau.
[9]Beginning with his tenure, however, Trier came to rival Reichenau as the artistic centre of the Ottonian world.
