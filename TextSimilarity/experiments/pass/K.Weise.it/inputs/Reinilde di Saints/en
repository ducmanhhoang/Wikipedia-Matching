VenerationSaint Reineldis is primarily venerated in Saintes as the patron saint of the town. Some sources even indicate that Saintes owes its name to Reineldis' martyrdom. The parish church of Saintes is dedicated to Sainte-Renelde since the Middle Ages and has preserved the relics of Saint Reineldis. This church has a large bell tower built in the 17th century.  Saint Reineldis' patronage for eye diseases is due to the association with a water well in Saintes known as "Sainte Renelde's well", water which is believed to cure eye diseases. 
IconographyReineldis is commonly depicted with a sword or being dragged by her hair, referring to the decapitation. She is also portrayed as a pilgrim, because of her journey to the Holy Land.
