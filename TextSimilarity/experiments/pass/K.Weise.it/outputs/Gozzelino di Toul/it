Coming from a noble family in franca, Gozzelino was the notary of the chancellery, directed by the 914 to 919. In 922, king Charles III of France designated him as bishop of Toul, and was consecrated on the 17th of march 922. After the devastation caused by the danes, and hungarians, Gozzelino raised the fortunes of his dioceses, reformed the existing monasteries and founded new ones: in particular, in 935 (or 936), founded the Abbey of benedictine nuns of Bouxi√®res-aux-Dames. He died after forty years in the episcopate. Venerated as a saint, his liturgical memorial falls on September 7.
Numerous objects that belonged to him, a comb in the liturgy, a book of gospels, a chalice with its paten and a ring of the bishop are located since 1803 in the treasury of the Cathedral of Nancy.
