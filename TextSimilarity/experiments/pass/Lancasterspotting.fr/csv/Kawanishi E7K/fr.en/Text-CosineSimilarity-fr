[8]The E7K1 was ordered under the designation Reconnaissance Seaplane Navy Type 94 (九四式水上偵察機 ) and entered service in early 1935.
[9]He acquired a good reputation, which was hampered by the lack of reliability of the engine, Hiro.
[10]The latest copies of E7K1 were equipped with a more powerful version of the Hiro 91, but this does not improve the reliability.
[11]In 1938 Kawanishi developed the version improved E7K2 with a motor in star Mitsubishi Zuisei 11, it first flew in August 1938 and was ordered by the Navy as a Reconnaissance Seaplane Navy Type 94 Model 2.
