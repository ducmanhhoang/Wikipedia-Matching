[3]Design and developmentIn 1932 the Imperial Japanese Navy requested the Kawanishi Aircraft Company to produce a replacement for the company's Kawanishi E5K.
[4]The resulting design, designated the Kawanishi E7K1, was an equal span biplane powered by a 462 kW (620 hp) Hiro Type 91 W-12 liquid-cooled inline engine.
[5]The first aircraft flew on 6 February 1933 and was handed over to the navy for trials three months later.

[8]It became a popular aircraft, but was hindered by the unreliability of the Hiro engine.
[9]Later production E7K1s were fitted with a more powerful version of the Hiro 91, but this did not improve the reliability.
[10]In 1938 Kawanishi developed an improved E7K2 with a Mitsubishi Zuisei 11 radial engine, it first flew in August 1938 and was ordered by the Navy as the Navy Type 94 Reconnaissance Seaplane Model 2.
[11]The earlier E7K1 was renamed to Navy Type 94 Reconnaissance Seaplane Model 1.
[12]The type was used extensively by the Japanese Navy from 1938 until the beginning of the Pacific War, when E7K1 were relegated to second-line duties.
[13]The E7K2 continued in front-line service until 1943 and both versions were used in Kamikaze operations in the closing stages of the war.
