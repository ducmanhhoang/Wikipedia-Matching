[10]January 2011 Storm GTSDer Lister Storm GTS debuted at the 1995 24 hours of Le Mans in the GT1 class as a competitor of cars such as the McLaren F1, the Ferrari F40, the Jaguar XJ220 and the Porsche 911 GT2.
[11]The first presentation of the car, driven by Geoff Lees, Rupert Keegan and Dominic Chapell, was not particularly successful, because he was due to circuit problems after less than 40 rounds.In 1996, the Team decided to treat the Storm before the Le Mans test run, and so he took part in the 24 hours of Daytona.
