[4]The Macchi M. 39 was a hydroplane race designed and built by Macchi Aeronautica in 1925-26.
[5]An M. 39 piloted by Major Mario de Bernardi (1893-1959), won the Coupe Schneider 1926 and two world speed records in the same year.
[6]Design and d√©veloppementLe M. 39 was designed by Mario Castoldi (1888-1968) to represent Italy at the Coupe Schneider 1926, this is the first monoplane low-wing that he designed for Macchi.
[7]It was a seaplane race single-seater double-float of mixed construction (metal and wood).
[8]Wings in wood were stayed, two-thirds of their upper surfaces was used as a radiator to reduce the drag.
[9]The pilot sat in an open cockpit protected by a windshield trim and integrated into the fuselage to reduce aerodynamic drag.
[10]The floats contained in the fuel.Donald 1997, p 594.
[11]The M. 39 was designed specifically for the Trophy Schneider which earned him some particularities: for example, the left wing is slightly longer than the right wing to allow the plane turned tighter to the left because the circuit had turns in this direction.
[12]On the other hand, the floats have a buoyancy that is different to counteract the torque of the propeller.Macchi built two types of M. 39: a version of training and competition.
[13]The version of training had a V12 engine Fiat HAVE.2 liquid-cooled 600 horses, while the racing version had a Fiat AS.2 800 horses.
[14]Macchi built two devices of training, the three devices running and a cell non-flying for the static tests.

[24]On September 16, 1926, the captain of the Italian team cup Schneider won with one of the aircraft above the Lake of Varese and was killed in the crash, but the development of the M. 39 was continued.Donald 1997, p 594.
