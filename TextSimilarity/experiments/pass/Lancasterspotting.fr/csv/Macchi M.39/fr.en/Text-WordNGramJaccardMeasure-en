[1]The Macchi M.39 was a racing seaplane designed and built by the Italian aircraft company Macchi Aeronautica in 1925–26.
[2]An M.39 piloted by Major Mario de Bernardi (1893–1959) won the 1926 Schneider Trophy, and the type also set world speed records that year.
[3]Design and developmentThe M.39 was designed by Mario Castoldi (1888–1968) to represent Italy in the 1926 Schneider Trophy race, and it was the first low-wing monoplane that he designed for Macchi.
[4]It was a single-seat, twin-float racing seaplane, of mixed (metal and wooden) construction.
[5]The wooden wings were wire-braced, with two thirds of the upper surfaces used as low drag surface radiators.
[6]The pilot sat in an open cockpit parallel with the trailing edge of the wing; the cockpits windscreen was profiled into the fuselage decking to reduce aerodynamic drag.
[7]The floats carried fuel.Donald 1997, p. 594.
[9]The course circuit required left turns, so the left wingtip was slightly farther from the fuselage than the right wingtip to allow it to make tighter left-hand turns.
[10]To counteract propeller torque reaction, the floats had unequal buoyancy.Macchi built two types of M.39, a trainer version and a racer.
[11]The trainer version had a 447-kilowatt (600-horsepower) Fiat AS.2 liquid-cooled V12 engine, while the racing version had a 597-kilowatt (800-horsepower) Fiat A.S. 2.
[12]Macchi built two trainers, three racers, and one non-flying static-test airframe.
[13]The first M.39, a trainer with serial number MM.72, was built in only a few months.

[15]Operational historyThe first M.39 to fly was the trainer MM.72, which made its first flight on 6 July 1926.
[16]On 16 September 1926, the Italian Schneider team captain stalled one of the trainers over Lake Varese, crashed into the lake, and was killed, but development of the M.39 continued.On 13 November 1926, the three M.39 racers took part in the 1926 Schneider Trophy contest at Hampton Roads, Virginia, in the United States.
[14]It was soon followed by the second trainer (MM.73), the three racers (MM.74, MM.75, and MM.76), and the static-test airframe.
