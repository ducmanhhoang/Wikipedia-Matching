[1]The Piaggio P.7, also known as the Piaggio-Pegna P.c.7, was an Italian racing seaplane designed and built by Piaggio for the 1929 Schneider Trophy race.
[2]Design and developmentSeeking to avoid the aerodynamic drag induced by floats in seaplanes of floatplane design, Ing Giovanni Pegna of the Piaggio company designed a very unusual seaplane to represent Italy in the 1929 Schneider Trophy race.
[3]A cantilever shoulder-wing monoplane, known both as the Piaggio P.7 and the Piaggio-Pegna P.c.7, his design floated up to its wings on its long, slender, watertight fuselage with the wings resting on the water, and employed twin high-incidence hydrofoils to get itself off the water during takeoff runs.Vašiček, Per.

[5]Sources differ on the P.7s engine; it is described both as an Isotta-Fraschini Special V6 rated at    and as an Isotta-Fraschini AS-5 of  .
[7]The engine was connected both to a two-bladed automatic variable-pitch tractor propeller by a long metal shaft and by another shaft to a smaller marine propeller, similar to those used on motorboats, mounted beneath the aircraft's tail.
[9]The two hydrofoils, mounted beneath the fuselage on struts just forward of the wings similar to the way in which floats were mounted on floatplanes, would cause the P.7 to rise out of the water almost immediately.

[15]Although some pilots refused to fly the aircraft, the Italian Schneider team{{'}}s Tommaso Dal Molin conducted some water tests on Lake Garda in northern Italy.
[16]The spray the hydroplanes generated made it difficult to see during takeoff, and persistent problems with both clutches ensued.
[17]The aircraft never became airborne.Not ready in time, the P.7 was excluded from the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, in which a Macchi M.52R and two Macchi M.67 seaplanes represented Italy.
[18]Piaggio and Pegna abandoned plans to build a second P.7.
