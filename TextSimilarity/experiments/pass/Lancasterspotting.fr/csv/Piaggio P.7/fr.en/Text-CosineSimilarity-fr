[1]The Piaggio P. 7 or Piaggio-Pegna P. c. 7 is a seaplane courseitalien designed and built by Piaggio for the Trophy Schneider 1929.
[2]Seeking to avoid the aerodynamic drag induced by floats of seaplanes, the engineer Giovanni Pegna, of the firm, Piaggio designed a float-very unusual to represent Italy at the Trophy Schneider 1929.
[3]The Piaggio P. 7 or Piaggio-Pegna P. c. 7 is a monoplane wing high cantilever that did not use hull or floats.

[8]Sources differ on the engine of the P. 7, it would be either a v-6, Isotta-Fraschini Special of 970 hp, or an Isotta-Fraschini AS-5 to 1000 hp.Vašiček, p. 35.
[9]The motor was connected, by two different trees, both with a propeller air two-bladed variable pitch automatic and a small propeller to marine, similar to those used on motor-boats, mounted below the tail of the plane.
[7]These two hydrofoils were mounted under the fuselage just in front of the wings in a manner similar to the floats of seaplanes.

[15]Although some pilots refused to fly the aircraft, the Italian driver Tommaso Dal Molin conducted some tests on the Lake Garda, in northern Italy.
[16]And clutch problems persisted and the plane generates a lot of spray at take-off which were a hindrance to the vision of the driver.
[18]Do not extend loan on time, the P. 7 was excluded from the Trophy Schneider 1929, in which a Macchi M. 52R and two Macchi M. 67 was that of Italy.
[19]Piaggio and Pegna abandoned the project to build a second P. 7.
