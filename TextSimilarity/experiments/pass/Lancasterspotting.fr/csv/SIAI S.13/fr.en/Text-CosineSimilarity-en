[1]Design and developmentDesigned by the Società Idrovolanti Alta Italia (SIAI) as a smaller version of the earlier S.12, the S.13 was a single-engined biplane reconnaissance-fighter flying boat.
[2]It had a crew of two in side-by-side seats behind a single windscreen; the observer has a single trainably-mounted machine-gun.
[3]The flying boat was powered by a single 250 hp (187 kW) Isotta Fraschini V6 engine.Emile Taddéoli, a Swiss flight pioneer and later chief pilot of the Ad Astra Aero, left Switzerland for Sesto Calende where he was hired as test pilot for Savoia in mid-1914.
[4]During the next five years of activity, Taddéoli made more than 2,700 flight tests, flying about  .
[5]In January 1919 Emile Taddéoli was pioneering again in crossing the Apennine Mountains in a seaplane between Sesto Calende and San Remo.
[6]On 12 July 1919, with a passenger on board, he flew from Calende on Lago Maggiore to Lake Geneva in 110 minutes, overflying the Mont Blanc ( ) massif in his SIAI S.13.
[7]The Royal Italian Navy took delivery of 12 aircraft in 1919 and the flying boat was exported to Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Yugoslavia.
[8]In France the S.13 was built under license as the CAMS C-13 and the Spanish naval workshops in Barcelona also built seven under licence.A single-seat version, the S.13 Tipo, was ordered by the Royal Italian Navy, but was later cancelled when the Royal Navy decided to develop the Macchi M.7 instead and a civilian version, the S.13bis, failed to attract any orders.
