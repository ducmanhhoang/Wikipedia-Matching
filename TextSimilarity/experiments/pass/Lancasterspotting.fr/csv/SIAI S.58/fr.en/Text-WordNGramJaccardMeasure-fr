[1]The RAIS S. 58 or Savoia-Marchetti S. M. 58 was an Italian prototype floatplane fighter of the 1920s, designed and manufactured by RAIS.
[2]S. 58En 1924, the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) issued a tender for the replacement of its seaplane fighter Macchi M. 7ter.
[3]To compete with the Macchi M. 26, RAIS developed the S. 58.
[4]It was a seaplane, a biplane single-seater, built of wood, with a hull based on that of the seaplane race RAIS S. 51, who had participated in the Trophy Schneider 1922.
[5]The engine of the S. 58, a V8 Hispano-Suiza HS 42 produced 296 hp, it was mounted on struts above the hull and it had the effect of a pusher propeller.
[6]RAIS suggested an armament of two machine guns Vickers fixed mounted on the hull on each side of the cockpit firing to the front.Green and Swanborough, p. 527.
[7]The S. 58 made its first flight at the beginning of the summer of 1924, he established shortly after, on August 25, 1924, set a world record altitude for an airplane of this type by reaching 5,831 meters (19,130 feet) with a payload of 250 kg (551 pounds).
[8]RAIS built three prototypes, but the Regia Marina chose to save money remotoriser the Macchi M. 7ter to extend its service life, rather than purchase new aircraft.
[9]RAIS built, however, a S. 58 extra, which was used by the Scuola di Alta Velocità (High School Speed) to Desenzano.Green and Swanborough, p. 527.
[10]S. 58bisSIAI later settled, on the first prototype of the S. 58 a V12 Fiat A. 20 of 420 hp, redesigned S. 58bis.
[11]In 1927, the Regia Marina has organized a new competition for the replacement of the Macchi M. 7ter, where RAIS joined the S. 58bis.
[12]The Regia Marina found it interesting enough to order 97 copies of the S. 58bis, but this order was cancelled after the Regia Marina has once again chosen, as an economy measure, to extend the service life of the M. 7ter in the remotorisant.Green and Swanborough, p. 527.
[13]S. 58terÀ the fall of 1928, the S. 58ter flew for the first time, it was a slightly modified version of the S. 58bis, which also used the V12 engine Fiat Has 20.
[14]In 1929, the Regia Marina has organized a new competition for the replacement of the M. 7ter where RAIS joined the S. 58ter.
[15]But he lost against the Macchi M. 41bis and received no order.Green and Swanborough, p. 527.
