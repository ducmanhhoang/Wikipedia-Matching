Design and developmentThe Societa Idrovolanti Alta Italia (SIAI) refined the design of the SIAI S.9 into the SIAI S.12 a single-engined biplane reconnaissance-bomber flying boat. It had a deep, contoured forward hull with a slim tapered rear section. The Italian Navy were not interested and no orders were placed.
Operational historyThe aircraft was used for the 1920 Schneider Trophy race, where it was known as the Savoia S.12, the contest was won by Italy as Great Britain had withdrawn from the race. Lt. Luigi Bolgna was the only pilot to complete the race in the Savioa S-12, achieving a speed of 107 mph (172.6 km/h). The aircraft achieved a maximum speed of 138 mph (222 km/h) on 7 January 1921.
