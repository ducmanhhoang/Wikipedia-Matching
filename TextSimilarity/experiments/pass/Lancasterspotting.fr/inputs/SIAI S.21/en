The S.21 was a single-seat inverted sesquiplane—its upper wing was of shorter span that its lower wing—flying boat with its engine mounted on struts above its hull and below its upper wing. The   Ansaldo San Giorgio 4E-14Aviation: SIAI racing seaplanes (Racing hydroplanes SIAI) engine drove a four-bladed pusher propeller. Small stabilizer floats were mounted beneath the lower wing on each side.
Operational historyDuring test flights, the S.21 proved extremely difficult to control, and the only pilot who had success with it was Guido Jannello, who had already made an impression at the 1918 Schneider Trophy, in a Savoia S.13. When Jannello fell ill at the time of the 1921 Schneider Trophy race and was unable to pilot it, the S.21 was withdrawn from the race.Japanese Wikipedia SIAI S.21
