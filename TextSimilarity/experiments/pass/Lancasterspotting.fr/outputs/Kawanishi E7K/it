The , also identified as (code-named ally of the Alf .) it was a seaplane reconnaissance single-engine biplane baggage developed by the japanese Kawanishi Kōkūki KK in the thirties.Employed by Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun Kōkū Hombu, the air component of the imperial japanese Navy, beginning in the mid-thirties, he remained in service during the second world war, coming used, in its final stages, as the plane kamikaze.
In 1932, the imperial japanese Navy requested the Kawanishi Kōkūki to design a replacement for the Kawanishi E5K. The result was the Kawanishi E7K1, a biplane equipped with an engine Hiro Type 91, a W12 engine, liquid cooled by a 620 Hp (462 kW).
The new aircraft made the first flight on February 6, 1933, and was delivered to the Navy 3 months later for further tests.
He felt immediately a wide popularity, but its spread was slowed by the poor reliability of the engine, Hiro. Later, the new E7K1 were equipped with a more powerful version of the Hiro, but that had the same reliability problems.
In 1938 Kawanishi developed the E7K2, improved version which had a radial engine, the Mitsubishi Zuisei 11 of 870 Hp (649 kW). After the first flight in August of the same year, went into production with the name of Scout, naval Type 94 Model 2. The E7K1 was renamed the "Scout" naval Type 94 Model 1.
Use operativoL'E7K1 was widely used by the imperial japanese Navy since 1938, only to be relegated to the sub-tasks to the outbreak of the war of the Pacific, while the E7K2 was used in the front line until 1943. Aircraft of both versions found use as a kamikaze in the final stages of the second world war.
Radio-controlled by a test pilot, lieutenant colonel Tomoyoshi Hori, the two seaplanes were carried out several test flights, taking off both from the surface of the water from the catapult to the aircraft of the battleship Yamashiro.
