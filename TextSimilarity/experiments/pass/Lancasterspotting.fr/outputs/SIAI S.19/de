GeschichteDas the previous model SIAI S. 17 should win according to the plans of SIAI, the Schneider Trophy, however, was not successful, and crashed into the Lago Maggiore. With the p. 19 a new, more robust machine was developed that built on the conception of the p. 17.Like the previous models, the S. 19 was a double-deck flying boat with canoe-shaped wooden hull. The wings were, as with the predecessor machine SIAI S. 8 to SIAI S. 17, with linen covered with bars and steel wires attached to the fuselage. Since the Motor of S. 17 was too weak, was built for the S. 19 of the larger Ansaldo 4E29 V12 with 550 HP and a two-blade propeller. Instead of the previous engine mounting with wood spars Stahlholme were used. It was not, however, the engine for the Schneider Trophy in 1920 and safe to install, so the s. 19 could not participate in the race.
