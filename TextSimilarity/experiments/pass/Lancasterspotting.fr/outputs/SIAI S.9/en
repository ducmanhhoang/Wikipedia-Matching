SIAI Savoia S.9 was an Italian reconnaissance flying boat manufactured by Societa Idrovolanti Alta Italia (S.I.A.I.) from 1918. The wing structure was unusual in being a single-bay biplane wing with additional struts mounted mid bay at the junction of the flying and landing wires so that it appeared to have a two bay wing.
