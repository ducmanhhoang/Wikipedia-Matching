DescrizioneL'the acanthus is a herbaceous perennial plant that can reach a height of 1.5 m. The leaves have a long petiole and robust, and a lamina bright green; they are of the form pennatifida with lobes deeply cut-toothed. The drum is floriferous (port i.e. the flowers directly on it). The flowers are collected in long spikes terminals to form cylindrical; they are rather showy for the chromatic contrast between the corolla (white in color with shades of pale pink) and the cup (red-purple). The stamens are functional and in a number of 4 to each flower, to which is added a stamidio. The fruits are capsules loculicide bivalve opening explosive. The seeds are rather big and smooth, color brownish-black. The flowering period is from march to June.
Distribution and habitatL'acanthus is popular in the mediterranean region, western and central; its area extends from west Africa to Croatia and also Portugal. In Italy it is common along the coasts of both the mainland and of the islands, penetrating more and more into the hinterland as we proceed towards the south.
