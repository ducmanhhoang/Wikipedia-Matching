TaxinomieCarl von Linnaeus in 1753 named the species Delphinium consolida . In 1821, Samuel Frederick Gray renamed the Consolida regalis , a name already given by Gaspard Bauhin in 1623 . In 2011, thanks to a phylogenetic study, Florian Jabbour and Susanne S. Renner show that the genus Consolida should be grouped to the genus Delphinium . According to the principle of priority, this species is found in the name given to him by Linnaeus.
