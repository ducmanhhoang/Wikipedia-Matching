The Black mullein is a perennial Plant that reaches heights of 50 to 120 grew, sometimes up to 150 centimeters. The stem is up a sharp and often dark red to overflow. The leaves are on the under side gray-tomentose, upper part – in contrast to many other Verbascum species, however, almost bald, and this fresh green-acting. The basal leaves are usually petiolate, at the base heart-shaped and irregularly crenate, the middle stem leaves simply crenate, and oblong-ovate. In the extended, glands, loose Inflorescence, the yellow seats in a similarly arranged balls, often red-spotted flowers. The Inflorescence is a branched panicle or raceme unbranched, at most at the reason a few of the side-to-side grapes can originate. The Corolla is externally pubescent, densely and has a diameter of sometimes more than two centimeters. The stamens are purple-violet woolly hairy. The longest flower stalks are twice as long as the calyx.The flowering period extends from may to October.
Occurring nThe Black mullein is scattered to widespread in the whole of Europe with the exception of Portugal, Ireland, and South-Eastern Europe. It grows on waste land, embankments, roads and roadsides, dry meadows, and in sparse forests. In Austria she is to be found in all of the länder, often, only in the Pannonian region it is missing.The Black mullein, and the Actual Austria-mullein vikariieren ökogeographisch, i.e., in a particular area a species is either (almost exclusively), or the other. During the Austria-mullein occurs primarily in dry-warm sites, it will be replaced in the cool-humid areas, in large part due to the Black mullein.
